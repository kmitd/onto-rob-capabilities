Org.uk and fantastic as well Sainsbury's the Offspring The Offspring to drive their car let's have a little statistic from Chris this is 20% of new drivers crash within 6 months of passing actually if you're a parent and your child 17 and just passed and you're wondering what to get from tonight since birthday you're not going to get much better pound for pound than in advance Mo does it show on your driving licence I've never known that no it doesn't be to get a prick certificate to carry review follow me but not too close to you yeah I can say that um I mean I can't see any reason that from which would realise that you were mine will 83 37 th and then he rode a motorbike numbers 23 24 with 2 incidents both his own fault and one thing then take something in the back of your bike going down to ASDA at 3 o'clock in the morning when we've got forward to the snow on the ground because fundamentally you will fall but I think that is one of them and the other one actually wasn't his fault and that was the case actually better observation potentially wouldn't have still better odds ratio for the person who he disappeared underneath would be no um understanding health fast something like a motorcycle Accelerate is is also worth noting because your cars probably what 0-60 yeah yeah that's quick that's just blink of an eye speed is intent to emphasize your not doing anything absolutely yeah um very nice hello mean at 6 attacks helium who's going to pick them up from the cold in which tablet we talked about it the sun in the sky how to be the driver so the reality is a 10th birthday party no brainer don't do the party get driving what is the party and why not you think about boxes for the insurance company have a permanent cold now good or bad try to reduce insurance costs Chris yes definitely deuces it what year on year club I had 12 first he is um and most of them now come with websites and you can track what you doing they can track what you doing this is this is back to the whole dash Cam yeah and and and Big Brother really but for sale all about safety making sure you're safe that's right the right time I can't I mean I've never really be cynical of it I've always thought it's a good thing but I know I really really invested in it John the bus driver a full member of the I'm going to have to wrap things up because we literally I mean I'm sorry to the ghost in milton because I have actually run out of time I want and I'm going to ask if you come back again for another day to come back and we'll talk about yours yes driver accident I think this has got to be done this is dance transitions it if so and I really am at time I'm running on telly time at the moment which is close to finishing um we'll see you next which means you have passed you know I've been tempted a number of times and there's no excuse not to do it Terry Collins as always we are sounds and I completely fantastic today but I haven't done it I might somebody what's your connection to the I am well I'll at least two guys as well I passed my test at 17 and my thoughts where I just wanted Morecambe  \"I looked into the iron and local groups as well the gyms involved in the milton Keynes advancement and I've yet I just wanted more confidence after passing my test and the advanced driving lessons that my dad gave me that confidence and I really really improve my driving skills but it's really really good tell me some stats about I am format drive talk about the cost um I was little I never complete list of soft driving tracks in April the government does x to record the total cost for a fatal accident UK that's so we can say quite comfortably that's got up jobs to do with a rugby surely I didn't know it to do without repairs it wouldn't be highways department bath anyway if you're anything to do with the boat in Devon 2008 milton Keynes I still feel sorry for you but not in milton Keynes one of the traffic jams of us if these roadworks Reading maybe three minutes to the average um possibly after 10 at rush hour when you say we don't like so yes please don't drop us a line and transitions and I'd love to have you even talked to me or for your type w w w dot dogs is nothing is it really when you think about that that's the cost of a skills for life course having that I can quote this because I had a friend for the network and talking to me the other day and night with family for their took it to friends wife after the Cinema Sandwich cinema I went for a pizza before hand have nipples just got 200 quick gotten in one night so actually you know for a night out with the family giving them a nice time you could go and do your own course for actually less than the price for a night out and give your family a bit of documents in a bit of peace of mind we are concerned particular young drivers Chris's you have to say Chris a little luck thinking do I need to get to the end Ascott under steering is going get a minute the milton Keynes advance notice group we've got a really good offer on and once you've completed your test after doing all the sessions actually discount the course and we give you £50 back so the actual the overall package will be about £99 just for young drivers but you have to pay the extra smile I'm sorry buddy by the way he wants to see what the camera sees in a radio station will we live on air if you've got the telescope that um lookers Arbor at transition sounds and we are live on air now currently you're going to be looking at my FB face because I'm turning around but I'm sure I will if it's improved driving is that by giving your ditional skills all by improving the confidence that you had in the skills that you'd already got the original text I think I think it's building on the level of skills that you get from doing the normal driving test the basic driving test Stephanie Bills on that um but to really really Good Intent hazards what I like the anticipation when you come up to Hazard it's brilliant some of the other store the other benefits of doing it is I've noticed my fuel cost go down that's one don't presume least £303 Tesco alright it's definitely yes what time are you talking 1970s your folder can't exactly I'm thinking better now I think in some ways you know you know you do get in the bed now however you should be all the bullshit but I'm well aware of the fact that my driving skills are not good at work for not sharp as they work I can't because you salute singles released driving experience the truth is I think that's the key is You look I know my know my reactions and I would need quick as I wear when I go out I kind of expecting lot more now than I did you know I'm trying to fully aware of looking hands on the top of steering wheels done driving up towards a car but if I mean I used to be much like this until very recently in it any point if I was going up the side of traffic the key indicator makes the driver's wing mirror and where the hands on the wheel stands on the top of the world looking in the mirror there's a handle for the top right-hand side of a steering wheel and it's just been a glancing at me I'm almost certain it's just gonna drive in front of me and that's just the Way It Is and yet we can know what we like about people being here it's not me but I don't leave we are all responsible for and driving is an accent over 100 percent anybody else if extant any more incidents sorry I love you baby and I miss you I really do it means after dinner works " .

transitions on Dave Simpson and you're listening to Secklow sounds community radio 4 milton Keynes with me today in the studio we have Claire Wildman and Jerry Collins returning it again say hello to your mum my feet so there are some recruitment agents that are posting job live online so following nose and then following where that other people sharing them and think that's the beauty really is so won't you share them they get shared all and shared on and she done so if somebody knows somebody looking for a particular job and they spot one on Facebook they share it to them so I suppose we could be looking at situation here once upon a time if you were living in milton Keynes and you looking to move to Birmingham for example your moustache I know somebody in Birmingham to be able to get hold of them to say that can you look for the local papers can you tell me what's a bear that's not the sole ok so you can actually be thinking of emigrating to Australia you can find that job on Facebook you could contact them on Facebook and say hi this is me this is what I do he is my peace this is my life what do you think I mean that that is really going to change the face so much so so I can kiss can be harder actually for the employers and then for the applicant explained so quickly it's easy for the applicant to find three social media but the company's then going to have a harder job collecting applications through all the different channels that they're working with you. just from the HR perspective just managing that flows information across so many different as many as I can get on Media yeah it's going to be a tough job because people will respond directly say on Facebook on Twitter rather than necessarily following the police applied advertising across a phased Advertiser suppose so Facebook this week Twitter next week love and then of course you know we're going to be doing view of how to find a job utilising social media in particular Facebook Twitter and LinkedIn as a combination and we'll be doing that hopefully in a few weeks time I think you know any business you have to be aware of what's out there and and and use it to your best advantage um I don't use things like um Snapchat periscopix didn't know about parents don't but they use Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Pinterest and delicious StumbleUpon Tumblr an interesting one I mean if you were looking for job now I know you have put your feet up and you are a man of luxury now you know swanning around the weather like 28th York no no I'm quite fitting a bath in a dinghy that Yaki hat how do you think social it would have changed your path given the fact that you very tired but if you think I am 10 years old can I get referral from LinkedIn anyway I get a lot of offers on LinkedIn for jobs and for business propositions yeah I'm lucky in that my profile is read a lot why I don't know but it is um and you know that this those things that go on the people when I move into this country the various things and they won't represent representative in this trip so you know you can get a lot of that sort of thing um so I think that will happen and I think going forward that that's going to take people into a different world where what we used to call head hunting is going to become Facebook hunting now or LinkedIn hunting because you know people are looking for the right type of staff and if they get a unit linked to you have to put summary of what you do with what you've done and all that sort of thing and that can fit into many slots for other people to love you so I'll believe it I've even got a profile on Facebook which is not really there ham and a lot of people don't actually you I don't like Reddit and I don't know where it goes anywhere I don't use that the general in most of them Google Plus very yeah she should be used but there's a lot of paper on there just for social services data for everything on there yeah that's ok we'll can contact you and anything else works absolutely nothing going forward it's going to work even better do you think now bear in mind for those of you who have not heard me banging on in the past which can't be many people know milton Keynes have a look around just about everywhere the S6 Edge occasions there is one of my favourite um and I'm a big big advocate cash system of moving people in the round it's where the the original idea of transition came from and is still very much truth so if you're underage and very keen to hear from you at the moment please tweet me at at transition sound at all become tier 1 in a few weeks time also and you're coming back and look at this on periscope we're here that there is much nicer looking and I am very very lovely really really lovely um yeah that's me I know Claire still trying to find out if you found me I'm definitely not up the kids and technology more somebody to replace and tell us how to search on periscope and what's all the hearts I like the heart for awhile I scared heart I like likes another heart oh yeah oh fantastic heart I like likes that we never got to hear those um back to my original question before I got lost in the world do you think schools have an obligation of the education system so I'm not just class in schools in this I'm talking about the whole system so colleges universe do you think that you turned your phone off to actually ensure that on top of English maths science with including how to use both social media accounts in the car I don't know about whether it's a responsibility or not but it would be advisable I think is a good way of making sure that people are aware of the potential Dane of using social media and William that you've got the key aspects of things like people putting it out there that they're at a certain Place when they advertise their address earlier so letting people know that nobody's home but haven't things like that say phone in sick at work and then the posting that they're out with their mates on Facebook and that's that's becoming very common now that you really do need to think about what you're putting out there and I like the fact that it's encouraging people to be honest because you're being very clever um I walk past with my Paris for your mate pet thank you in the picture you can't avoid it can you so the key is I mean we have to learn working so we have to learn to use the it is very soon is now in your pipe still isn't Google become something building your chosen platform Facebook that's where my animal dangerous losing out with her head I think it like you say they're actually going to people too much more honest for both of you to want to run some periscope at transition sound for now but we will so shortly let me today um it's alright for some reason I pointed it out that side and have viewing figures went up so I don't know where that say something about me or something about you guys but there um yeah I mean look apparently the world is the world is changing please finish reviews at transition sound or um 728 Secklow sounds drop on the website Transit Secklow sounds football and will be revealed now that's some really really interesting stuff going on within the world of Secklow sounds some of that you have seen the piper and somebody you haven't but there's a lot an awful lot of things going on very big time trust and Faith Postwick 207 done and I'm quite proud to say that I am I joined at the right time people of Ambleside Twitter um presents on LinkedIn Google Plus would you have used social media when you're at school I don't like me to be honest answer I struggle with the fact that people tend to be actually physically using and various other things up at school and at work because my upbringing wish you go there for the purpose are designed to me I really stuck with people in the workplace using Facebook set finder to use it properly it's best to focus on one and then do bits on the others clever companies on a building in so making it part of the m and help better to promote your company then have your workforce been able to use Facebook and say good things about company they work for you if you can't that's why you can't ban social media it's impossible we go to I go to several companies we can suppose there are no we don't have a social problem what is banned the use of Facebook and all the rest of it you know it you can't you step outside that door and suddenly the world is now tweeting go on the mobiles we're getting 4G which you know I'm on O2 if you're lifting O2 please bring 4G to milton Keynes is here but it is so catchy UK photo editor I've got 4G I'm with 30 USB 3.0 yeah you're ok but for some reason are taking their time bringing 4G to milton Keynes and it needs to happen it's the thing is they all use the same areas where to licensing is what the problem is licence is not actually do it because I don't build your own it's all done through the ones that are already here so we can learn something new everyday ok again did you listen to Secklow sounds and community radio 4 milton Keynes my name is O2 Stinson at the show is called transition with us is Claire Wildman and Terry Collins you can Twitter Sam please Twitter Sam on transition sounds for action this is where I live on periscope at transition sounds we are in the studio and hello I might come on Friday morning between Secklow sounds Emma back welcome back to those who run the witches bizarre because if you just wondered if you're not coming back my name is Dave Simpson this is Secklow sounds and the Show school transition call hello Secklow Claire please just found it on the I'm all excited there now we are both periscope in each other from the opposite sides of the shoe pleasant life so we're alright that's ok um we're talking all things social media how do we control where we have to accept that how do that how do they Terry mention an interesting point there many guys I'm just playing with them first ever mention an interesting point regarding some of the other platforms that used we have to work with it I think um and NM that's going to be in better working with employer something about us out of step with working for myself people will talk about work so it's only a problem if they work don't agree we will always have talked about work haven't heard of course yeah it's just said it's out there now for the world to access you rather than just your mates somewhere somehow I could have any of it but I'll never mind Terry you'll be ok one day um I think yeah you're right I mean once upon a time I suppose what used to happen would be you were done you get an apartment little bit work in the pub and you pay already stated in this life isn't everything everything we do now is out there it's live the world sees it we have mentioned this before but we have Sky News For You things like hootsuite except a minute I am I a platform in the round there a portal on 12th of every year for all the others basely is very good aversion I suppose that something my Periscope I'm sure there are the platforms available as well the periscope see anyone on all the moment as a formal complaint with but you couldn't even log on the Sky News app that you can be a reporter still excited about social media is absolutely live absolutely key how do you use it as a tool - 7 really quick with little little stuff with play on a pic of you again I'm not like that you when you disappear for 2 weeks so you know in school now ok and you were looking for that how would you do that using Flash a new media let's stay away from Facebook and Twitter than a wooden one that lets a new media that hold the whole smorgasbord of touch maybe examine how would you use that from the job because I'm sure there are people out and now you're in this position you know so maybe just leaving school just finished an exam the other guys were talking to um we want the show to collect what you need and we want to be of some use to you that's the whole reason we exist how would you go about finding that you're using as new finding the job getting a job and I think they're dead to quite different things that you can have finding Tara yoga to get getting however finding basically it's still going to come up when you're searching so any job whatever platform they're advertised creating the opportunity for a job would be slightly different in the east as you mentioned early you could start getting in touch with companies it so it would be a way of getting some work experience you could contact them directly social media on and ask for the opportunity to go in ask for the opportunity to go in and help or just to go in and observe practice appropriate for what we're doing at the moment um I've read Chris evans' autobiography and a book which one he started out by offering help free on radio to get the experience to get the understanding of how it work people in huge amount of hours to get his dream job by contacting people and saying let me come in and do for you because I'm going to use that as a slight jump in here and I'll move if you are in that position and you fancy a big desk I don't use the pro version that don't use the other one radio it's a comfy chair in a very very light fashion Sue Perkins broke last week but if you want to sit in the chair visit the Secklow sounds website which is some www.sense-lang.org go and have a look on there you will find someone on there is that a link to an applications if you want the chance to be on the radio la la Chris Evans of flowers please fill in application form in it and send it back to us we are community radio um we're here for you and to give the community opportunities to have their voice so without you jumping on board um you know come to wish you an idea of the show let us know what's going on and we'll see if it if there's anything we can do it to make you at home with that situation so ok Claire let's take it we found a job we weave contact them initially and they want to know more how would you go about that they want to know more let's say the jobs in Glasgow and you're a milton Keynes and you're looking to relocate you found the company I want to know more how would you get around using new media not that jumping on the train going up there embracing you Media how would you secure a truck what are you pretending that's coming in how many different ways you could do it you could send and receive video of what you've done who you're done then and everything else is there a modern country they're going to look at your social media anyway to see what sort of comments you put on and that's why I say people is that he's very careful about what they put on Facebook catherall careful or on solano Hollister careful because people put on things that in anger and upset with someone and that stays on there you know that it's things like that although I might have a disagreement about a certain things going on in the world really got to keep their opinions off Facebook because if you're looking for a job companies will look at their Matthew this this is this is the thing I'm trying to get did Knights use to manage this makes use of bad language you know we shouldn't ever that you shouldn't type something you wouldn't say and you shouldn't say something that offends the Unknown I'm absolutely an article about manners Duke of nothing and I think sometimes I forget that so so expletives apart and then I'm bad language should we stay up is it right that you withhold your future is it is it right that you don't say something about what I don't like the way this is being done how do you think would like to set my alarm in a couple years time maybe I might do that on a social Media platform that leave that is your opinion that is your view and if you go to an employer who is backing annalistic were the walls is a walk at West Country ales at Warwick country b and you don't go can you put on your face make you page but using no no no actually gonna be a bit more sensible man but I follow the advice I'm not going to post that on my phone used Amazon you get a job and you'll find that without you knowing it's like that put it my Facebook page you're not working for a company that is directly supporting that what's at Leeds you if you still really dating don't agree with it and your network from your dad's what you do but I don't I still think you shouldn't put it on because you know it does reflect on you as a purse it doesn't matter in the Europeans connection get you in a mole trap on them um I mean there was an actual case on the telly that you'd leave it was a real live show and this girl was rude to Scramble With the company you work not everything all the time but I mean I am a couple of years ago and didn't mean it but again with that how was it put that thing with his back to how was this put onto incorrectly worded it that question I kind of point of some kind of Essex I suppose if you were if you didn't agree with something but the company you end up working for support today view is completely the opposite of yours could you stay um yeah I think it depends on the view that the answers that is no so therefore would it be right if you put that on your social Media platform because at the end of the day um some opinions the best you know to yourself and although I do believe people shouldn't hold things back something something about you Facebook it is one of the world's worst for that sort of thing and it's only the people that make it like that they put comments on there that they really believe and I don't disagree with them I disagree even put it on and off platform like that 75% my business keynes Direct infant so if it's something that you really do believe in it it's part of go back to one of the earlier shows your core values it's that important to you cook a little bit but be careful how you share it in terms of hand you would things be considered the appropriate and just get your point across it's is like anything when you're trying to share your opinion with somebody don't make it um necessarily controversial just share your opinion fact this actually she can teenage somebody else might agree with you and be waiting and get a lot of comfort from that comes to your employer that's your choice then again about do your values match your employers values can you handle it if they don't stress quotes and it's something was becoming footsie time in years gone by cancel image search get a chance to search about the employee you're going to work for as well as they get a chance to search about you very much the way I do it's quite simple I view Twitter will talk about the two most established once again if you will come and not just in the studio we are live on periscope um probably best if you listen to us and what is at the same time how about that we are live at transition sounds so we try and that one again this week so her clothes and I'll give you a little bit of everything for anybody that is watching some Periscope no you know thinking what you're doing and then and because and then again pick your audience was suppose you know we have clearly yes but very very cautious very money implications yeah I suppose I'm sitting in the world I want to know what you think about that particular thing and I want to know how it means to you but I want it to be Pro um that's a little too I want to but not any polite but I would like it to be well so if you're going to publicly state your opinion evening conversation we we all live now I mean I have the world's knowledge in my phone that's that's where we go um after I have the world's knowledge on my watch but that's really were does Claire stand so yes have your opinion about whatever it is but if you're going to publicly state that in any platform and that includes you know talking to somebody in the bar but I suppose it should do shouldn't if you know then then I'm done trying to find a polite way to say get your facts right but ultimately that that's what it boils down to is it now I think even if you've got your facts right I think you still got be careful about what you put in the public domain um you know you've got a thing cuz you know it's like everything else for me ok I'm I'm old and I have different values and sum of the thing for today but if you have a tattoo when when I was going for a job you wouldn't get it now and they look like now that's quite acceptable and I have got a problem with it but you know it I'm talking about times at button in 20 years time when you have made that comment and all the sudden you how many times have you question why did you leave your last job yes or why would you set from you being sexist it is is it isn't acceptable issue but if you started it if you get sacked because you're worried a fight with a manager with that company in for you I think this and this is why I am I pick my guess the Word because we have played with have had a young and thinking and then we have Terri with Love Actually to be fair you know Terry has a lot of work with sir with young people and his use of Steel not I may try coming cuz I use it but you've got a very modern views but you're right the tattoo thing is an app Simon I've got tattoos and they all stop at my wrist so hang on a second speak to Facebook if you are a minute it wasn't a criticism criticism of tattoo so we are here we are live now I see have you got a point but on time just thinking there are still some people I'm a friend of Mines got what I think they call them sleep now but he said that for you any regrets the day you read and done because there is a manager I was his only understand business but he was a manager within yeah because you know I'm down and then regretted it would have the conversion before about um I was one of the everchosen clever did the whole day six and all the rest of it you think you can come I'm having station you write down a lot space outfit at least I personally I'm not sure why I like my tattoo and in fact I think there is really getting a valid point here that is relevant so I'm going to stop the tattoo conversation because we done will you be off track but I am going to bring the tattoo and parents back in a few weeks time I think because I think that's one with them so if you're out there and you're in the end of the rest of us young looking very interesting um please please do drop us a line using the hashtag transition Secklow sounds email us for for my attention for the transition to um I'd love to get you on the show you're looking at us on periscope again please get in touch if you ever milton Keynes you have tattoos get in touch I want I want to know your opinion um equally can I say this sounds tattoos yes Tattoo Studio yes please I'd love to have some of my tattoo studio here um um if there's somebody from a laser clinic that's listening that may pick this please please please get in touch I'd love to have you all round the table with Terry Claire myself could be huge um Clare just before we wrap it Up and today wouldn't be looking at social media and the impact that it turn the telly on the world that we live in today I'm asking to include things like how do you find a job using social media how to use it as a tool instead of fun the various different platforms that the way I see it the way I explained to them from the students I came across as if you take Facebook as a shop window that so much but I think my main comment would be just think before you press character often as I could just agree with Claire on that because um whatever you do social media is it good and it's bad you've just gotta make sure that you're doing the right thing by DSLR can give you that I can say that you bought it make sure your phone doesn't ring in them another sorry that one was actually ok will be like in mind this has been transition I am David Simpson um big thanks Claire because it's The Terror we will see you again same place same time next week playing exam oh they're it so comparatives going solo so well then did really weird looking we just went to bed Harrogate can you use it to display your wares and to sell your profile at Topshop window that's great it works fantastically worst witch off these much one door to door selling would you grow a planet like that but yeah it's and to see if you have to be there in the moment very much so um where is with Facebook you dropping any time that suits you yeah yeah I mean Twitter this is a funny I mean I use drive programs that work there because Saints Twitter change electrical tweet and it used to I used to be able to all my tweets in one place with every every 45 minutes here but I really found that that was not really the way to do it as clear as you said I think you got to be there at the time the room and Nursery responses you get trapped update it no because doing it that way is cheating a frozen somewhere that there is a program instead of just the way we use it currently United States side of this one thing and I think I should become something quite is the use of real-time it una edition using more of it but I think if you go on to Yahoo for example and you search other restaurants in Portsmouth on Yahoo what you want it all return is it all Google or Bing or I need the others around it it will return the 10 most popular that's the one thing that the website please could be managed global at uniform because of Angeles Hanley Twitter in particular you can no you don't do it when you put a tweet Garmin Southampton where's the best restaurant to eat and what you get is people from Southampton coming back to the saying I actually the best restaurant is here and a bit of his ex it's a natural person not on the phrases. I really don't like that in Germany so please do tweeting and an email in and you can treat a sore neck Secklow sounds using the hashtag transition or you can currently tweet me on a transition sounds and and buffalo things will get through to the studio at some I think going forward again I did it again we're we're going to be using social media in a match because so I can find work as a consultant through Twitter I know you both found work again through social media do we sing swimming at school leavers this show is transition it is based around and I'm moving from A to B your nan and growing up do we sing as we go forward that we're going to be when you have time to post on Facebook is anybody ever seen a job advertised on my no claims that chili post local jobs at the milton Keynes get up if you don't know anything I've seen on Facebook itself or out and about I can take picture with my phone and put it on my page because it's a great way for people to see jobs I wouldn't otherwise things you know if anybody actually apply for when I grow up every other day buy Claire's post on Facebook we want to know what we're going to do I'm not sure but we do want to know um yeah

me today is Terry Cullen and you know it's people don't reply to my know that for a fact as I have put something up there and I have had a reply the um but I don't like putting them sort of things that they're really because I don't think it's to platform 4 more than this quotes don't like this plenty of groups out there that do that you can join them Facebook Emma Bridgewater what is it there for when you're up in your body be honest if anybody ask me that you just said it's a way of keeping in touch with my family because I don't give anybody in the family come from originally still down

talk to me if they want to know what I'm like before they set foot in the door so it gives them a great opportunity to see how am I a really rather than my professional polished website persona which hope your man's not to Polish because I don't believe in it but you can get a very different view of somebody from there sent from seeing them interact with other people in a genuine way through it coming into the world now we want to know who were working before we want to know the person the real person behind the same person but we cannot always been able to have access to the real person I want to expand on that one tell me more when you think that you would normally if only had access to the website true and catalogues marketing brochures now we're opening the door and saying this is the person behind the business all these other people behind the bar it's much more welcoming that should be synced right social media Texas Facebook becoming the new Golf Club would you say yeah person for myself you know it could exclude quite a lot of people with Facebook is open til to wider groups of people yeah sorry you were both I haven't got the physics that do you want to consider

the other but there was a piece of blog from bidsketch and what they look at is his reasons why you're better off being self-employed if that's what you're interested in doing one of the things that they put it's great to be your own boss  \"you can earn more money but then the trade off with that if you don't always get holiday pay and sick pay so you have to actually facts about more more money

Communities Together on Secklow sounds come back to life style MK we are pre recording this shirt from Bletchley Park that was The Beatles and a hard day's night now we have been looking at business this week and again of feature experts and this time past the element will be talking about business Ashley is an actor and that means he is self-employed so he goes through all the things that self-employed people do that was a bit of it is different because he doesn't always know where his next paycheck I was just having a think about this this week over to us to be honest if we could we go away being self-employed works extremely well for a lot of us and there are many reasons why we are at whatever the reasons whether voluntary or not or whether the industry you in does not give you a choice but to be self-employed the biggest hurdle we face in my opinion is job secure especially when coupled with the fact that as studies have shown a greater percentage of people who are self-employed find themselves at the lower end of income distribution just mention job security and you will find me squashed in the corner of a darkened room curled up in a fever set usually does nothing to I do what I usually do when I come across any herbal Just Pretend It's a tiny bump in the road and ghetto let me share the three things I do when I'm about to give it all up for a pushy but mindless desk job which I know I will hate right from the start number and that she commented on Sunday always supposed to be message back as we don't feel too bad for me because I'm sitting in my pj's on the sofa but I'm still work if you're working but it's something I enjoy it's quite difficult kind of work I fancy you if you're working and enjoying it I think it You Phillip go through all the skills you have in your Arsenal and identify what you can improve on and do it vine leaves to grow otherwise you will become also make a list of other skills you should giving yourself a realistic and achievable time frame is vital just make sure it's both realistic and he remember being self-employed means you are your own product increasing your skills enables you to offer your clients and customers motivation that for me this is Hugh unless of course you are one of the lucky ones who can just leave out of bed every morning like a Disney princess with a pontoon of birds and other woodland animals singing you happy which I am sad to report I am not I have to find ways to maintain that spot which first lit up 15-20 years ago you have have to find ways to feed the passion constantly otherwise it will die out now last but by no means play something for free is not just a case of giving up your time we have to factor in starting medication costs so to do something for free we are actually paying for someone's pet Healthcare out of their own pockets it does happen but clearly it can't happen a lot so we will go far support is vital to your survey if I do not have to support from the people I trust in love I doubt I would have laughed at this long having someone with a sympathetic ear is invaluable however I have also discovered that offering support to another when needed is just as far to never be sure to offer support because you never know when you need the favourite er thanks Ash what was so important as we've been hearing especially for self-employed to pretend to be answering the phone calls in the middle of the night and now the statistics are and this is from mentalhealth.org.uk is that it's estimated that nearly three and every 10 employees will experience a mental health problem in any one year and it's me possibly due to the recent and dramatic rise in Britain's working hours 13% of the UK population work 49 hours or more per that is your saying earlier Gill even though you're sitting on the sofa in your PJs your brain is still working and that's quite scary actually we we do seem to be until quite a lot when it comes to work what do you guys do in order to maintain a work why don't at the moment what would you think about the dangers of starting a business based around your house real hard luck stories charities that has the RSPCA PDF they do exist and they do a great job I was talking about that because it's awesome is an escape from work and then that becomes you comes one and so actually you can end up counters UK yeah because you're actually doing it in a while it's hard because when it comes to going self-employed what we tend to advise generally is have a second form of income which just me and you Austin staying with your old work so yeah you end up working 80 hours think you have to be realistic so when you or if you're thinking of going to it doesn't matter what you doing with your doing training you're doing additional training all you're doing what is something you want to do any other way so good get into a situation where you at Direct advert he'll give me the perfect job if I can just hang on for so long now if I get that little bit more training and meanwhile you will spending 47 and a half hours a week doing a really crappy job because this is the week doesn't happen in 6 months not cut on the head what do you exit strategy be rich I think at the end of the day with anything you need to be organised if you're not organised yes very true you need to have somebody there phrase so I'm probably the worst person because I do what was talking weekend I've got an Xbox I haven't played the Xbox more than I can tell you I will sit there and I feel guilty about spending two hours oh yeah it is important I think for me personally what is I've had to take a step back and I just have to be realistic and I can't always check say it natural for me to try and help a friend down by saying I'll do that what the public milton uneasy about the fact that our income basically comes from the unforeseen misfortune having a play that is your work area yes I'm not using it for Recreation and vice versa on the sofa I had to make that change and it made life a lot easier once I done that but the funny thing was in the spare room upstairs upstairs because it was it downstairs it's actually easier to work there and then 14 switch off the little foot table lights that work done and I can then go into the living room exclamation light shutting a door and that's really nice yeah it's about having space psychological I don't really like to talk about my dad being realistic we have to make a living a recent survey showed that if you woken an item founder wrapped in your bar when I get home how is your day personally I don't think talking to it I don't find that Carron Phoenix do the work at the the Office quotes on I that works I'll have to say but I got it it would be cheaper to

actually I feel better but I do have a Daryl where are you still switch to desktop go into the computer and write a blog actually have more is a mental block then if I could actually there and I left because I couldn't I want one of those people I can't just do one thing I need to be doing at least 45 felt like I style myself to the desk and it felt more like a joke secret star is to do what works for you and one of the things I will pick up on because I might deliver business training on one of these things is what you do when you have a bad day at work actually talking to your partner isn't the best thing to do necessarily party because they may well be very desperate to help congested to listen to you but they don't know your job and if they can see it's upsetting you first Instinct is to say because you don't want to leave you just want whatever the dressing to go away sometimes it's actually better to seek that sort of support from your colleagues or other managers because they understand what you're going through but you've got to find what works for you and as you think about that there its own Boomtown Rats and I don't like Monday if you worry about the level of your bet I'll have a think what am I paying for but I prefer to save money and use of practice that has no out of hours cover or less parking for less advanced equipment is so nothing wrong with that another teen stabbed in the playground he wants to play with the title a lesson today  \"number Boston Lincolnshire no reasons cause there are no reasons why the whole day talk about lifestyle MK we are talking about business and it's a very special show today because we are pre recording it on international women's day for shoutout for all of women business business women that lets me recording it from Bletchley Park in blocky which is the Old transmission block now we have been talking about work and talking about work life balance which is something that we almost it was all I know when I was teaching full-time so this is literally you know you going you don't have all the school holidays off by the way I know that we had her first three days because my body actually just crashed so I don't use a visit a natural high or is that a business to say level of pressure because I think a lot of people would say that to me adrenaline when I'm running on adrenaline that's why we all need to get to in some ways we will be looking at the difference between working for someone being self-employed the pros and cons of both and we'll be looking at all kinds of jobs as well I know a man cave is about cool chicken and also it's international women's day so we are going to be celebrating Women in Business and we got some amazing University what is required to give you an itemised breakdown exhausted I just really come down off it and so I'm very tired after the crash but the flip side so you get a natural high is actually problem you knew what to do it sorted it out and it sort of self-confidence I almost died and I think that's more of exercising yeah that that what that's the one where Eddie and the confidence he is very different to best way to discuss cost before the event even if you and we don't really enjoy confident speech at 6 seeding me being able to um pack stuff on the back because she has known what to do with its it's completely different and hormonal response and as is the one where you meet your colleagues and bond with them all of them bring up happiness but they don't necessarily by the same bits of the brain fight or flight bingo as well isn't it not this one the next point they say is making major decisions helps us live longer and it's apparently that's a study carried out by the University of Texas which revealed that the workers Who spaced fewer pressures or have little control over their job with 50% more likely to die within 10 years of quitting work milton that was that seems counterintuitive because I've always heard but that could have just been up you know it one of those rumours that is it all miss them if you have a very very high pressure job and then you suddenly stopped your body found it difficult to cope with the difference between high pressure and high responsibility because of you chicken sitter insurance and make sure you know what cover your self-confidence and if you know your job well then actually dozing so with that one what you saying also there I said a few things up there is no NHS for animals for all private vets have to it's your trusted and you have that sorted City given to you that respect given to you that's also the self-esteem booster as well if it comes as part and parcel of the person whom the song Deborah's if you're the leader of the tribe I think it's friend on skin that I think it's in your type of person you are the type of girl that you sick satisfaction for as well so many I think if you're not the person you probably won't be able to stay in there some bad apple still exist that maybe we're just trying to walk the line between offering what happens once but keeping the cost of what they can offer the last thing is that I'm having a double status in life can you lots can you just give us an identity but of course everything with work life balance it wasn't over identity talking money is one of the most stressful sides of a job especially when they're sick very nicely on to joules feature of the week is about internship so everything is looking out for free and then I was covered volunteering in seance to look at different aspects of business and one of them is unpaid work and why there is something you should really consider and with what's important part of animal health both for us and the owners Kelly have to benefit you it might benefit other PJ talking about working abroad in a min opening for this there is a difference between volunteering could be very short term you're not actually an employee you are there to Shadow and tray there was a time there was a suit filed in America recently because a girl I went for a which publication that girl was actually interning assassinations with your vet member prevention is the best he is legit and I said I am an employee of the company ricksen texting me to do so the problem is legally I'm talking about it you know it is an international country illegally claiming that a contract whether is verbal or nonverbal you then thanks Jamie and realised was really how much of what we pay for at the vet's goes on to technology which makes life a lot better for us than for animals and one of the things I was thinking about whilst you were sleeping with her we have all this new technology but sometimes we don't realise how much it does there is a big difference and say I'm sorry to A verbal contract is that the groom agreement of the agreement date when you return you will any expected to be there too can you just want experience on your case exactly the same thing for you just popping any just get a feel for the job and it can be a good way it gives employee or an idea of you as a person it's like it was really on interview but that's it you're not coming in to do a job you're not expected to add you know we can get a phone for on a pontoon on credit but on the monthly charge fish spread the cost out a lot more and that some things we don't realise that actually if you are paying for an x-ray machine oh you are paying for something massive how expensive it is verbal agreement is you agreeing it would be like I'm saying to you I need you to come in and I need you to work for the next can we talk the minute you have got any conversation that you are an employee and you are Tina Sarah any expectations from either the employee then you are free to do what I want to look at as I know I do have a licence and a very negative I just want to be absolutely sure that get themselves into a situation where they feel that it might be good for a career and I'm looking at city no like in the Arts Centre Donna early Aaron big naked Heart isn't so it's very tempting to keep doing things for free and whether it's actually games you get it we have been in recession for a number of years for Inland and it does mean that it's employees Mark I don't think that anyone should then feel that their self belief and value is so low that they give anything more than I take hen weekend can't afford to you could make you work for free that line Donald's and get paid you don't need to do the internship full time so that you would say you can do it you have to appreciate that vets on charging you this much money to look after your pet just because they fancy having a new man is not that I'm sure that makes cardboard going shopping on a Friday hey you're still getting the benefits experience the employer still looking at you and again once you have any kind of agreement in place with employees so make sure you say ok right it's and it's 8 today I need to know by yeah but nice so you know I just want to be quiet that you know when I find Robin he message me starting business last year is called text Grace and she's just written this about how she is going to pass out from Rob best thing ever say about being self-employed is it so exciting and hard straightforward and is always so much to consider is definitely worth working for working for three research everything properly look at all the outcomes and don't be afraid to fail because that's when you learn how to make it work three days different and you learn to trust yourself not hard work is a must because you can't fall back row line no salads you do work until you get it get to see your dream grow and expand before your eyes I would say if you want to be self-employed bought a new phone EMC at which days will be for WhatsApp out which days will be what's or what's so example please do it regularly and keep an open mind and a biggest thing is having good support network around you someone to call you back when you feel like you should be due Saints ok hard work in Rio m is really working it doesn't really work well because we end up working longer hours however I absolutely love it I make sauce insurance for your cat so I need the operation you'll not trying to Guilt Trip investing for nothing and say pays mortgage because he thought you know yeah it's been being realistic and just seeing if you don't go into something like it think of new ways to improve everyday don't limit yourself strive for success and always believe in yourself because I will be there for you though everything you're doing and safe we don't want to carry on but you will do anyway and because of those days you'll get through it and you'll appreciate the really good day brilliant thank you very much Jill and

Why was the feature guitarist in the film Crossroads which was Sir Walter Hill movie another part from the ATM for the soul to soul and yet check it out on YouTube The Crossroads guitar duel um for an example of Steve I'm always flamboyant man ok so you from Steve Vai to Vinnie Moore very much a great example of one of these cells is Newbury to get that this called Neo classical elements and this is another song I actually have flexi discs Pakistani journalist one of the record entrepreneur can I come by raid feature types being sent for round the world and it's out of 65 as featured in invite

us a fantastic story I mean he was he was another one is very very young yes that's the other thing you'll find in this programme lot of these guys were born in the Middle East Midlands and ambitious great some great songs that sort of a bit more Uptempo bit more mainstream bit more Rocky almost like an update of sort of early sixties and um it's got a great story to it and then he honours his career to a credit card um ok he was Bay City Centre pre agreed credit card with the limit I think he's pushing 30 on at this point and at that point if you haven't made it by mid Twenties muscle forget about it and sexually through everything on that credit card recorded his first album not of this earth that made in the field thank you get a good deal for this surf with the alien and then this out and I think it was the first instrumental chart in the U.S billboard 100 says paper like Jeff Beck and I'm searching on his great because he also easterbrook mainstream for acceptability to this extreme guitar star not married is there that I will pick up straight away tell me he also bought in Santa clarita crazy tremolo tremor work is tapping was unique he did this all with caudal approach where is a lot of guys before Gail c get this linear fast and he could do hold melodies and sore Jung guitar and um he he was am very different from the rock well done what's called lagarto Carter so they came out the starting block fully formed with the 10 o'clock see in the speed and and and the all-round virtuosity of these guys was unheralded I don't think there's ever been a period in how do I not as a guitarist who is Sam the next track is Sam by Michael John norum now John norum that everyone listen to this for the third John norum repeatedly much they're sort of noise no doubt just as his guitar solo was on Final Countdown which you by the band Europe this week and um but you know that she left your wallet on the Final Countdown and this is from you um a 1987 album

of July she's playing alongside it she's in a group called The Delilah sisters I like you I like talking on a I get I like talking in general um um um um I talk alot in real life day today life um probably should shut up most of the time it works for a chat show though not gonna lie but we're not when I've got people in the studio I just I just want to turn the songs off halfway through and you carry on talking and I can't do that and it's really bad I'm always tempted to just going to say the song out as I've seen a lot of presenters just stop the song Africa or just stop talking over the song and I before I started radio it that used to kind of wine me up a little bit when a present ever do that I can cook that I'm bored and didn't do it but I've done it a few times lately and I have had comments from people there please Ryan stop doing that we will listening to the song I do have some questions and surprisingly fluid but all I heard was quite a lot of I'm only going out for a few I've got a we don't have time to answer that many no I love SIA I think she's incredible I have voices is stunning I don't have my favourite song plays at the moment and I might play that later in the show um but this is one of the old ones you know it wrong not old but the song that really made um I hope you didn't ask you want me to see your names on it which is switches on but nonetheless I am going to add some of these things are good some of the month um well not and not good day just I don't think will someone appropriate for air and and some I couldn't really going to debts with let's let's kick it off again let's have presenter you look up to I don't know it depends what you mean if you mean it Secklow sounds I love drive time I think that's the presenter there he's fantastic he's really really is great but if you if you look at a wider scale I'd probably say to Greg James yeah Greg James ice I think I really like to show and I get a lot of material from the show yeah yeah yeah baby Greg James I think favourite actor your favourite favourite actor at the moment I'm going to have to go with Jack O'Connell but Leonardo DiCaprio out of nowhere is is working his way up the ranks and moment for me I think he's he's doing well obviously um ok that's so controversial George Michaela Danny Chloe other Daniel lissing alongside Katie B K T Tunstall us we got here early but let's just keep looking think Jess glynne going to be there you have been my car is over the years I would say I thinks quality reasons it might have to be maybe George for Michaela Michaela has been the most reliable co host yet so it's Danny Danny was then he was like that friend that came in and I did a lot of humour to the show so but McKayla was especially like on a first couple series she was phenomenal talking just talking in general but yeah I might have to say George because I've just gone between other than one George's in the Studio with no silent moment we don't struggle with anything it is very natural I'm going to go with George sorry everyone oh ok am I single I am I am at the moment yes there is no point me getting any more details favourite film favourite film at the moment like some most recent song what I've watched that that is in my mind straight away when I think of my favourite film is the revenant however I also love and broke up yeah I'm going to go with a broken that's for Jack O'Connell Louis zamperini I think it's about exorcist true story incredible Story of Us just live somewhere to the beginning rights let's keep going if I could be anything what would I be I like scratching actor that I be an actor but I don't know if it would be a film actor or a theatre actor if it's film out something I would like to direct as well was quite a lot of people I give you some more details on that if you if you want me to get involved I don't have any songs plan today I'm going to just see how reliable you view as our and let's just see if you can you can give me good enough request I've already got quite a few but I need more because we're going to do an hour of music in preparation for tomorrow's big Friday singers disco I think it is driving especially with his buddy I think it's a disco something that's pretty much it for the news this week and you know what today I've decided because lately I've been planning my show yeah yeah actor are used to want to sing I used to want to be a singer but not any not anymore I'm sorry I'm just I just got a couple more coming in tell you what I'm going to carry this Q&A on after restore vactric uni 2nd America brilliant I've got a few more like a friend just joined in and he's no it's doing a few and he just asked quite a few minutes after a couple of these rights if you had £10,000 a week and you had to spend it and not save it what would you do with it and why are £10,000 a week in the had to spend it and not ok so it's ok I think I get it I don't know I really don't I mean if it is it is it would just for one week I'd put up so I put a lot into the business that I've just started a run what businesses just started from I buy new equipment I buy crew advice software advice laptops side by loads loads of things other words you know everything is isn't as well structured we've got new games coming when when obviously we we return back to the studio but today this is gonna be a really relaxed oh you know you're probably just got out of work you're probably in the car yeah sounds resource me if it's really good question to this Nando's chicken skin or not Nando's chicken skin on or off I'm sorry don't ask me that but I love and Nando's guilty as as the next cheeky lad time I can't believe I just said that that was disgusting but yeah I like it on obviously I mean is everything going to Nando's if you're going to take this the chicken skin off what what's the point in that there's no point let me know what you do at home because I've never heard of anyone take the skin off um and also just so you know I love a medium and a half once in London in for another few hearts but that one had it in London and their we're all in tears and I am what I want my friend's got to be funny to do an extra extra hot sauce on my nose and that's that's that's a story for another day um have I got any projects coming soon I have I have I got to music videos with two different singers

this year suspension for that's why it's summer um OK how long have you been a presenter is something is going to stick at do you mean at the station flights it I've been presenter at this station I think just under 2 years now I think it's a yes I started in February 2014 so just under 2 years and is it something realistic as I said I want to be an actor but if this is something I want to do as long as possible because I do a door and I want state exercise is long as I can but eventually I would like to do you know keep keep keep working the way out and You Know radio 1 is there is there is something I'd I'd like so if you're listening produces a radio 1 but no I love it here it is a very community based radio station billionaire ok muscle I live by so you you must I stand by I'd say Ricky Gervais had one and it was it was something along the lines of um it's better to create something and be criticized then create nothing and criticise others I love that because I'm someone that obviously being in a certain industry that I am acting it's very easy to to criticize someone in this industry because the very vulnerable to criticism you never met someone that's what I have but there's no one there's a professional serious about the industry has ever been so spiteful about it um about getting bad comments its natural I take it is constructive criticism  \"you know you want to put your feet up and listen to me talk about nonsense and play good music so let's jack Garratt would say don't you worry this is all voice search so I can but then I think it is important to make sure that you are complete and you're doing well before you do criticize others not something that you know that your item to your opinions granted but you know make sure that their opinions and last one so that it that's it that is it and now it's pretty much the end of the show ladies and gentlemen I'm sorry that you and I went on for a little while um let's go back into a song says you put your feet back and grab yourself a cup of tea and I'll be back in a minute This Is Poison Rita Ora don't put any poison in your tea you know we're moving to SM so I'm not going to be on for I think things just over a month I'm going to be retrained so that the shows again be better when we get back hopefully um that would be good for you I'm more uplifted now then I was earlier in the show I should have should have waited until this time and started the show I would have missed schedule anyway where are you now I'm in the studio " .

hairdressers and dances when we were young I want to be an architect one point but I've got to about 15 and I've always been studying music and things so I ended up singing in the choir that's cool and from then on that was kind of my career laid out for me I did some music producers GCSE for A Levels for my degree art of musical theatre and kind of got into it that way I worked abroad as an entertainer I think the girls did very similar same as I've always like this kind of music it's all sorted vintage music and so I was needed to find the right girls to sing with me I think I've always going up like in music I learnt the flute as my first dolls musical and I can't get into reading music and then got me into the ceiling of music I always find the people who play  \"sing as well as the summer people have come across has had the flu and seeing something must go hand in hand because you can't you can't that's a whole new outfit she went abroad with your singing what did you do with out how much is an entertainer abroad so I was in the show team so we do evening shows for the guests are at the hotel but I'd also do the entertainment during the day so kids games adult games and we run the show at nights with the bingo and the kids disco and stuff so the whole heap of things to me was it like being a Redcoat at Butlins will it something to aspire to be a Butlins Redcoat

smokey singed Harry evening out what did you do vets Armley want to be a red coat have you  \"so when you came back the how did you want did you don't sort of want to pursue a musical career is that something that you could set your sights on yeah I wanted to be in musical theatre and everybody who sings musical theatre want to be in the West End and it's a difficult job to get into but why's everybody with moved to London to try and start some kind of career and other things got a fringe shows and what I do know if I can have make my own business for singing like with stuff to the victory sisters and we are and if you do a show in the Western you view put on it wasn't on the fringe venue circuit and I was in 2014 me and my friend who I studied with Mark we started our own musical theatre company called mtc Productions and Karen and Marcia we're both in the cast of this is a production of elegies for Angels punks and raging Queens they were both in that cast and I thought this to a great and ask them if they would like to be entertained with me and they said yes they did today what is more than five minutes and you know you should let me play with matches after all you knew what I was like before you married me I know I go and leave you alone you light the fire and what happened you decide to set the chimney breast out and as a chubby prepubescent I really lost it again the lost confidence I really loved before me in front of people Prestatyn cuz I had a brace remember that much and I went to an all girls school this this will become important thank you for help you I was playing the production of Oliver I actually have quite a deep voice and so I thought what will be the right part for you and Bill fight for all things music I just I register my mother said it was terrifying which I can fully believe and tariff probably that and the fact I was a 13 year old girl in Top Hat very Bazaar and I loved it from then on I tried to get into the menu and it just kind of went from there I did a very um the more academic degree but then I buy always carried on speaking musicals at university on the side and then came out to London as he's dead I went to drama school open up and carried on from now listening and just doing it that way did you get parts in musicals or Productions it's rather fun because I have children so although sometimes forced to live in the 1940s postal district do occasionally like to go in the 20th century or 21st century even and my youngest doesn't door Fireman Sam and it's rather exciting as a real Fireman Sam game he was slightly disappointed and we have a lovely vintage lamp shade in Art School and the fireman doctor said on the floor lamp shades of grey not the fireman outfit come through the door to a younger man and then eventually audition feathers production of l loved it such a beautiful show last meeting please tell your girlfriend we really got what you think I jumped at the chance of always low anything vintage actually um right from 19:20 holiday must say dear listener he had all the children had already left the building by then and yes we can deliver it sounds more dramatic than it really was love the fire was actually I managed to put the fire out before their time and actually arrive  \"this this music really spoke to us know where 3 girls it was all about the time of women coming forward and doing their car and I love that I love that about the forties and Karen will you following the same person decided that you wanted to be in to music or music as your career from an early childhood not actually I was more dance so I started out dancing from the age of 3 um I'm just a dancer of from then on really and then did I think about a lover and I did a song and dance and then I think I hope they sing a song from The Little Mermaid yeah the little mermaid Disney and then one day cup and came first night that was so much fun because of that and then  \"don't want to dance school and study day London for 3 years and then it was only in mice of the final years and don't go I met someone who gave me some really great site of private singing lessons I thought I actually I really really

using take the first sword of couple of Beats from retract that do it to research for that because it was very very hard did you have any clue do you have any idea who was seeing that I don't to be honest because it just says here the original cast recording this doesn't know who it is I apologize to all of them and it is a big cat is the shower scene at is a job enjoyed but not one of my favourites spectacular to watch but to the story I think it was more and then they got a little Pomeranian that I said that I was a little fluffy ball right next to a coconut little tits no as you do cuz I was quite funny turned up this testing articles so well with that in mind research as I've been looking into sun loungers what I'd die to go for normally but a good tune anyway this is the answer then it is he regional cast from anyway Richardson researchers found out you know we say things like our that's cute enough to eat then this is an aggressive response to cuteness but that's normal so they say researchers to 109 participants to look at pictures of cute fluffy little puppies and things are more like compared with neutral animals UW series vs 7 series stupid but don't say that I'm not listening the participants rated the pictures of cuteness and funny that's the whole also how much I felt the pictures made them lose control a feeling they have to squeeze are having might see you later I could just him and apparently the study goes well about that she gave people the chance to screw something after is not the animals they give them bobble Rex not quite this but study also said that seeing a cute puppy triggers our desire to care for the animal but since is just we might not be able to care for a puppy see if then we have a sandwich that's frustrated have a

Wilkinson's Secklow sounds with me Steve Whitton on a very special program this afternoon we are absolutely over the moon at to introduce you to two very special guests from a new Facebook group and organisation called UK astronomy buy and Catherine Marion and they are the founders and organizers of UK astronomy and at this very special program is put together to really talk about a very special event this happening in the next few days and that is the transit of mercury ok so little bit more about what we can expect to see or witness over the next coming I was looking at it for the first time let's be about see a proper fishing equipment if you're using and always you can make the lab like cast on to something else so that you can then look at it and that's rubbish yeah and yeah one of the easiest ways you can do it I'm in the only thing is Mercury is quite small one there and we do have some ok for a bear binoculars can't see a lot but slightly different from a star anything best bet to you really need some digestate for the best thing to do if you get to pick a card or paper even though paper plates you can get from Asda or something like that and which other supermarkets in one and you move them away from each other right and slowly car how big is your move away strip down in the sun cost $20 pieces first time I saw it was sometime in the early 90s and again not with an ex write something you use a colander to get a colander use it away from it you get about 10 or 20 let's have another bit of Music and that's remind the listeners of our competition if you can write him with the name of the artist and the song title for all of the songs about the transit of mercury now just before we broke for a piece of music that we went off to collect a paper plates and boxes and a colander to make some rudimentary observational methods for looking at the transit but I think we probably need to get you guys go over a bit more how to do this you don't have to do it just like that if you've got pretty much just a long Skype with the lens in it so you can use that again without never looking it because it'll burn your eyes out so we doing pointing towards where you think roughly this what is binoculars now I'm in this this world of health and safety gone mad and every police are not there has been some horror stories aren't there people if they are yes yeah well it's going to go and buy filter special online you need to look and make sure it's got a CD and a British stand careful we say if in doubt ask a local club to assist you with him are you looking for a Skype member to cover your phone ok so just just let's put this into a little boy context then because this is not just about an event for for the garden astronomers and anyone who's really keen on it is for you know the general public or anyone has it got a clue as like me so really just what we were expecting is there a really kind of her more of a lock and alignment of the Planets almost astronomer etsy set lights with beard comparison you're not going to see that then because your eyes on setup to feel pain like that so you can actually do the damage without knowing you've done it until it's done don't don't get scared off if you got the right equipment BA AmEx yes man is it something is not going to happen again for a long time I don't know when it's over it's done it's November people look at the sun all the time I do it myself I feel so I bought online and I made myself from the film so can do it don't look through the scope of a project it onto now is the transit of mercury happens on the 9th of May you never know if anyone's interested in having a look at that in a kind of herpes on a supervised I cannot join you guys cook like you're welcome will the weekend to do our stuff for her Emberton usually doesn't nights got quite nice. Sky there and us just near Raleigh yeah yeah it's Sports and Social Club Northfield drive mk46 5BS release is not an actual event your name is there just enjoying watching a transit I'll be there for about 12 do you want to pop down how quick pick so you're more than welcome filters and us ok so just let us know then what what is it that we actually will be able to see in a dependant regardless of what we well what you really gonna say it's just pretty much going to be a black round. I'll be around. It's going to slowly cross the sun it's Monday the 9th of May it's going to happen from midday about 12 ish yeah pretty much to the sunsets you've got a good what six hours are there so she get time to go out after work go and have when it goes across it's going to move from a roundabout the 9 o'clock Mark Cross to about 5 straightliners there so it goes almost through half way that's quite a lot try not to mistake it for them they can be the size of what is amazing because what you actually going to see all that it's just the black door Phil time to start with what is Mercury festival hats and Mercury is the planet that's closest to the sun and 10 things that same axis quotes I see is that is actually very difficult to see because it's so close to the sun it's usually invited out by the Sun's light so rice and it has to be quite you across the sea it normally is women on the Observer planet it has to be somewhere away from the Sun just leaving see it so you can only sit really enjoying or Twilight just before death like to know this is what's great about amateur what they want is they won't pay anyone November 12 twice as numerous son when mercury first gets on to the sun write down that send it to them they want to correlate all the days against your Direction in through the Facebook group. pictures on Ellen ok let's have another bit of music that reminds you of the competition pair of gloves up for grabs got that right this time and yeah if you write into us with the song name and the name of the artist let's have a listen to the next song shine bright like a diamond so shine bright like a diamond diamond diamond ok so the transit of me very special program with that the last song was in 2006 the next one's in 2019 is not too long to wait still in riots in our lifetime hopefully then after that it's not till 20:30 I'm here with that Katherine Marion and Ross hockham both from UK astronomy hope you can reach those guys by the way on their UK astronomy face please God UK Sunderland by email info at UK astronomy Aldi just before at that last me some music we're having a chat about look at the transit going on safely in the best way to do that and call some people want the catcher that as an image so it what's the best way of doing that the same cautions applying about not looking at the sun with your eyes at all alone um but again you can get film until just to cover that and if you do want to do that if you've got a DSLR camera and the ones that you can change the and then um you want very very fast shutter speeds ideally M11 4000 of the 2nd would be ideal herbs obviously the sun is very bright so that when it's the wife is out and white at the rest of it's a very very short exposures I'm aware of people using webcams and CCTV cameras online and the other thing you can do is having a brilliant idea I'm going to try it is um if we can get a picture with a talking about projecting the the light of the Sun onto a piece of time and through a telescope for like another half cylinder about taking photographs I wear this year's actually one of the longest ones so definitely worth what is wrong with the trial got filter from my Skype so I use use my maybe some of the listeners could then Pratt sending someone a photographs if they go UK there be more obviously you know this is a thing now what can normally be seen from Mercurial never little yeah yeah he's quite difficult because it's quite good so close to the sun could it all bits in between can really see it sort of in the morning or the evening sky remind me to go to the crossing the surface of the sun so they are really kind of ASDA Susie just before sunrise and just after sunset and that's when you can best see it and it's usually when it's at it's farthest sort of Eastern or Western a long day quite was notoriously difficult yeah but when you do see it because it is in between Earth and the sun it does have phases ASDA actually get to see you no like Half Moon half luck and yet again I just really write that you are at Emberton on the 9th of May ok brilliant good alright so we got this little conversation going to win these amazing love ok will be very few eclipses in the last few years I don't waste so I guess there's been a bit of Media talking stuff about what to do you know kids being encouraged to look at the sun gravity not with the naked eye but they generate some kind of apparatus also talked about that and the only tell people to do is to write in to either of the addresses that we've given out for you or are they can write to the pH at Secklow sounds. Org and just let us know what the name and song title in the name of the ok welcome back to work this special program on Secklow sounds where we're talking about the transit asthma national oracle event that happening over the next week or so relaxed specifically on the 9th and I have been joined today by a Catherine and Ross from UK astronomy who are two amateur astronomers although to be fair from their knowledge and stuff with talked about today so far I would not put them in the category of amateur well planning magazine Reading and now we know that we got the other what UK but what else is going on today in the sky waking the Planets saying we've got three planets that ok Darkness you're up and about Jupiter's we're the same for the over most of the night m and his glorious and big and bright and huge and hard um you'll never forget um and uh it is such as is it's there won't work for sunset it's there in the sky Twitter Southeastern little progress and we'll adjusted to wear amateur astronomers with no talk in the morning it's probably over in the south so you can see it pretty much any time and evening also got Mars and Saturn coming up they come up with little bit later they're quite low in the sky so if you don't have a great view yes that we just want to go get people to open up the back doors go outside in the car you will find a bit hard to see if they don't come up that high but there are very close together and they're about to say so we will be little bits of the east before that and which is worse after that Saturday course being the one with the Rings we might be able to see that there were two and that it doesn't have to be a very very remove mystart over the course of the night they will move sometimes even Transit Jupiter themselves so will see shadow how is an answer question and expecting I know you're not at least I know what are your favourite are up in the night sky how hard is a billion cities from but my heart is still with a larger use telescopes have been using the same way keen interest and passion for a bit more than a year I've actually been looking at the sky on a date with my adjust my eyes for 30 Something years so my heart is still there and there and probably always will me although I love my cat but the things I like as a big things you can't see it yeah fantastic ok and what a great way to start with a great hobby like that then with her and I don't like with the transit of mercury the things like if you look there's a line going from the star Sirius to Orion's Belt silver yellow red star called 11 and then food supply close all line-up in online and it is just Gloria and then when it sets off an absolutely ok guy so in this session Andy Sandford Ince ok you'll see my name when I first ever got special stuff coming up because over the last few weeks you've written out to your Facebook that was my favourite but then having done a b literally it's or it's a white dwarf star tiny little white crying if someone is dying pretty much it's friend all it's emissions all it's gas has been thrown out around it so it's like a little Polo men just sitting there in space and to see if there's nothing else say that just think that's that's the end of a star I will I mean I was asking what the greatest thing you've ever seen them in at the side yes I would Jupiter's always the same I think everybody sees it for the first time is it Arthur just to let me listen us know what's coming up then we're going to talk about what the trans actually is and how it can be viewed at safely course and I also what they'll see and the weather agency for real as well not just like grass I saw that form so when it's in a very elusive objects of a small it makes it even harder to see so and the event we've got coming up lorry you that we've got here at the moment the chances of mercury is where the planet Cross that say may I wish I was out in the fields one night what's let me out for a night and

outside and looking up I must even slightly carefully start looking look up yeah well yes when I go down the M1 on my motorbike and I see the sun there an outcome and I will solicitors to write back into find where the planets are right and how we are at an angle to it circle severe ever feeling a bit down joke ok good so let's say we got this competition going with this club so let's hear another Ryan to the russet Secklow sounds like they will give out the address little bit later on because what we want you to do is to write in with the song title the heart that may be entered in will be entered into the draw for this phone all things astronomy with Rust and Catherine from UK astronomy now guys where can we find out any more info then if we're starting again next week start find out a bit more well you a Facebook group in Ghana was it any questions like there's no there's no silly question ask it anything at all the guys on the great they won't they won't believe who you

avenues and for awhile anything you like and we're pretty much talking about astronomy and what milton Keynes thinking about buying it how to choose the right one that's what that events going to be a bear I might be good for on and then how you feel Facebook Great War last all the time what scope should I get as a beginner because they're such a just Winston yeah every song that's play mine's a manual and I just put it around my hand and so depending what you want to get out of it get it spit like saying I Want by car which one should I buy best bits come down to Embleton another test drive test Racing Stripes have a go if you share some things in the sky and see if you've really got that buzz and it all about something else sounds only up with you lots and I'll probably people bring their equipment along yeah after that all Gold Everything we having there is always time you're so good to be done with the presentation on the scopes and binoculars and then wherever do sort of like

old is spring coming up so we won't need them slowly but surely the winter just have to do world nursery self it is small set square good time will it go into the first night and I'm gonna be high as a kite by then Transit code on a celestial body appears to move across the face of an where is the closest planet to the sun and it orbits about every 88 days has quite a fast or bits and I create an audio the Mercury moving in front of the sun time I walk in front of you in shopping centres in the way it rotates almost perfectly vertically so it's straight up so it doesn't really have any Seasons so it I know it's really really hot but then on the other side I'm really cold sore yes well I know you do have to take care because we're normally when we we think we look at the sun but actually only looking at for the plants at it and we normally plants away again very boring information is 430 degrees Celsius in one side but could be - 180 on the other sounds like my wife's cooking don't say that cooking with just your eyes without any equipment you do need to have something to look through and you can get some special and glasses and then only attach to magazines and he's like Sky at Night Magazine with her and if you're going to look through binoculars and telescopes you must have you absolutely properly graded and zone filter and you can get those a moderately cheap think I can

about a member from Orlando furioso by Vivaldi somebody there with tremendous panache by Marilyn Horne you're listening to Classic from scratch with Catherine Rose and I'm taking you through some opera and we're looking forward 60 years now to the High points of Mozart's career involves going Amadeus Mozart of course um who is famous all over the world and as a celebrated as a genius and one of his great geniuses was writing fantastic operas and he wrote quite different kinds of opera he wrote some sort of but you know classical serious opera which was based on sort of Greek legend Mr Darcy king of Crete for example which is seen a useful answer for pointless if you ever on that show because nobody nobody really knows it and then he wrote a lot of Italian operas which were about comic operas I eat with a happier  \"another loss of appetite Sirius sat subject matter you have some really heart rending aureus and so on in the middle and then he went on to write opera in German he wrote am particularly famous Leeds the Magic Flute which was much more like a musical and was and not at the aristocracy but that are much more general audience so if you're starting out a lot from Mozart's of really good place to start not leave because you kind of know what it sounds I'm actually going to play in a very heart rending piece from a very amusing opera The Marriage of Figaro and I'm going to play Porgy and more which means I love give me some remedy and it's up from Act 2 of the Opera  \"and am the Countess is lamenting the fact that her husband account you have an extremely roving eye and it's a great believer in the doctor send urine with the right of first night but I won't go into on the family programme um but she believes that he is cheating on her arm and in particular wants to seduce the fiance of Figaro whose name is Susana fortunately Susanna um there's a lot of a very bright Samantha Young went and see you and puts into the right about in the end but meanwhile the Countess it is rather and happiness is a very very beautiful area and it stung in this recording by Elisabeth Schwarzkopf with the film on Film only Orchestra and choruses and conducted by Karl Maria giulini  \"send welcome to another edition of classic from scratching adventuring listening and with me Katherine Rose on Secklow sounds community radio 4 milton Keynes I'm on my own in the studio today so I thought I would actually give myself a nice day at the Opera because opera as a regular dismissal no it's one of my absolute passions I've really ranged far and wide from Vivaldi at one end right up to Wagner and Benjamin Britten at the other though not right up to the present day but I'll do that for another day and as always I'm picking some quite short pieces out of opera I know some people find even the idea of opera quite daunting um I just mentioned it just now says a couple of shots and they said all your heavy  \"takeaways heavy I love it's great fun a lot of it's very moving some of it's very light some of it is very heavy and I have to say ever since I was a teenager I was really quite moody about opera I was very very happy to be taken to the police that lasted 5 hours with a dinner interval um I remember my dad took me to see the file on the shattered by Richard Strauss the woman without a shadow which is very mystical and lush and the right sort of them intellectually do you print sorted psychologically deep under one of the reasons of Principe mention it  \"keynes I'm feeling very sophisticated and Daddy accidently when he was trying to pull me a glass of wine missed the glass and put it all down my dress so hopefully it with white wine so but anyway lots of Adventures in Opera which has nothing to do with wine and as I say I'm going to start with Vivaldi hand samba night league are just as a widow discarding her black robes shows all her beauty and brilliance gleaming so to work now I lift your hands and you actually hear the hammering and which is included in the school you have the handles on stage and then they go at the guys and girls on stage giving a girl work um at this is followed by a scene where um that the troubadour manrico it confronts as you China and discovers his his true identity but first of all we have this housing Corp milton the Anvil Chorus from il trovatore by Verdi outperform their by the radio Orchestra and Choir of your pyjamas conducted by Mark community and I should also mention the choir director miracle Buddha Man City Chorus work for the opera is a fantastic art in itself and that's a bit of a really wonderful singing there it is often all about the voice sent and that one of the most famous voices ever in in Opera is of course Luciano Pavarotti and I don't think this programme would be incomplete without him so I'm going to play you will know for Steve Earle eczema which is assertive to hear from a very light and very charming opera by gaetano donizetti l'elisir d'amore a all the elixir of love and this was performed in 1832 and this is Orlando furioso I just love that name it's an opera in 3 acts and with a libretto by another Italian called gratia braccioli and at the first performances in 1727 and Antonio Vivaldi of course the red priest of Venice have red hair and he was in minor orders um but his main passion and his main work was of course music amp and this is indeed performed in Venice am at the tiyatro Sant'Angelo um and it's um no and that was Luciano Pavarotti singing Una furtiva lagrima from done it cities in the elixir of love you're listening to Classic from scratch on Secklow sounds community radio 4 milton Keynes Tuesdays please film music and just had to follow on from that um satnam sanghera was saying how much he loved Purcell when he heard it so we going to have a little bit of Purcell just a very short snippets from the faerie queene which is a kind of opera is more like a mask or semi opera that summer spectacular with staging this is actually a William Shakespeare's comedy and A Midsummer Night's Dream very heavily adapted and when I tell you that this chorus is the Chinese woman and chorus YouTube definitely doesn't appear in A Midsummer Night's Dream and it's that's happy and free Verse 32 diary with nature's cheapest delights we never close but when you add two and one Bliss another invites  \"just a little quick squirting Purcell where the um that's happy and free chorus with the Chinese woman sung by Diana Saturn and it's the scholars baroque ensemble his artistic coordinator is David Furnish I should say that's not the conductor he is actually one of the thing is but he directed baby actually do that without a conductor um very different from the match later really in normal granddaughter  \"pitfall of a huge Orchestra and the stage chatting over and magnificent red curtains and sweeping up to reveal well who knows what sometimes with opera these days you'll never know quite what you're going to get and I've known people go to walk from be quite shocked actually it's a very um avant-garde some of the year and interpretations can be that sometimes it's tempting just to the shut your eyes and listen to the lovely Muse it's probably um not exactly what some of us would think of us as operating some people would refer to it as a drama Play Music and Drama with music but it does have what normal operas have it has Arias and it has what we call recitative where people some of it's kind of like dialogue set to music um it's that on some strange mystical Island some unspecified time I'm and VM clots come from the stories by Ali ost over the poet ariosto um and little sorts of exploits of the hero Orlando it was very much kind of episodic um not not one big clock wear something in the bills and happens at the end so I'm going to see them very energetic  \"um anyway I'm going to move back into the 19th century now having just left back into the 17th century we're just sleeping forward back at another 200 years and we're going to hear from LA Forza del destino which is on at the English National Opera at the moment and it's in a production by callisto p80 who is very the same infamous actually for his modernisations of that the staging of operas know this one is if that's not quite as soon as extreme as usual it quite bloody um la Forza del destino the power of Fate though it's often translated puts a little bit more that sort of literally as the force of Destiny libretto by Francesco Maria piave and it's based on a Spanish drama and Don Alvaro is a hero it's very complicated prop plot he accidentally shoots the father of  \"loverly Andorra soul in Ora's brother Don Carlos de Vargas attempts to track him down um and er if you know if it will end badly for everybody as as as a lot of these certain and 19th century operas do I take a friend wants to see La Boheme and I'm not going to ask her where at the end practically everybody dies and then he couldn't believe it he was Indian then he was used to Bollywood movies and that the end he just kept saying to me to you mean that they're all dead but they're all dead it's not a happy ending but I'm afraid a lot of the Grand Opera it is very dramatic but I think I'm afraid I love it I love it and this is La Vita e Inferno that starts with them along with it it even though it like I'm a monologue followed by an aria called ok in same uid anjali which translates as life is hell to the unfortunate I'm in in Vain I long for death and then he moves on to say oh you will have ascended forever pure to the bosom of the angels in other words he actually thinks that leonora his lover is dead and he wants her to watch over her over him from heaven this is the wonderful Carlo bergonzi who started off as a baritone and has a very very rich tone of voice very different from Luciano Pavarotti but I hope you'll find it just as good La Vita e Inferno life is a hell from LA Forza del

Co.uk click on the Tab that says wireless and it lists what time we have been broadcast and it will also have the entire back catalogue available for you to listen to and then must be about three years were there so that's some that's going to keep your keep so it's not just the Lindy Hop Dance that you teach what are some of the other dancers that are there involved from Lindy Hop or came out of the Lindy Hop movement that that you guys teach yourself as well ok but if we rewind just a little bit to dance one evening she went out with friends and we had a little time can you have a Lindy Hop and from there we tend to think about things like jitterbug next where are more acceptable form with er put together for mainly the parents of so worried to go towards the rock and roll in developed was filmed in Hollywood thinks like Collegiate shag which the college kids brought down to Harlem showed off at the famous event at the Savoy ballroom and underlying things like Lindy Hop things like authentic jazz which will see Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly and just about everybody somebody ru doing and American rhythm tap which is game is very much up which involved haven't call the Fire Brigade out this is another smoke and Fire what could possibly go wrong when you left me for Wii no they were very social thing that's something you went out and did so mi there by yourselves where you hopefully maybe meet somebody or you would go with a partner is there something similar to the day with people that want to come and learn to dance do they do they have to come with a partner or is it open to to anybody that would want to come along it was really nice to see the Ethos of social integration that came from the survival rate has been retained so that people coming on their own doesn't matter what the background is They Danced before or not we run dropping classes every time we run the class because we think of ourselves and our first dance class and how would we get into this thing so we keep the same fairy open so new dances a welcome to come along and don't get going as soon as possible so you don't have to have had any dance Xperia doesn't matter if she's got two left feet and there is a dance out there for you absolutely we teach such a range of different dances that we pride ourselves on being scared just about anybody going with we've got a few wedding dances on about people that kind of proves that everybody can move to music and it's not about being the best in being the trophy winning really too but having fun because of you go out have fun art jobs what's one of the most fun things about dancing music and being able to express yourself to the music do you see when people come along to your class  \"the changing deceiving relaxing and in kind of getting over the nerves and and enjoying the music little bit more information saying when you have someone come for the first time he says they can't do that and then got two left feet and they come in and within an hour that actually dancing it's not it's like really satisfactory you know the satisfaction to see them dancing it's amazing can you recognise when when people have really got something in them that make that let you know there going to be a fantastic dancer even if there's a room full of nerves and and don't think they can do it yes sometimes that solutely absolutely just lets through the way they move to music you can be the way they moved music  \"sometimes I've got it in them and I don't know if I've got it in there and it shall I ask to bring that how can I help people to relax cuz I'm assuming sometimes people turn up they are quite nervous and they are worried they going to make a big puddle of of dancing how do you kind of get them to relax and start her to get the moves going to in the class as Roma beginners class so they're also experienced to help new people calm and relax and getting his own but we do we have people crackling in then we want people to be involved so it is just fun with the whole thing is the sun is it different dancing to live music when it is too full of pre-recorded music we absolutely in love live bands live music is the most amazing thing because you don't know what's going to and the brakes in the soul then always in the same place I just did anything can happen so fast it's more challenging and we'll fine and we love to support that it actually if there's any fans out there that will come and pay for it please get in touch with w w w w w w w well yes that's exactly what I thought I say what can I do that too far worse than trying to burn the house down well we had a little Anarchy message from Harry to say that he'd lost the rabbit so this isn't our daughter into meltdown because she was office leotard upset and then that was closely followed by the fact that have you found the rabbits and it was Tangled Up in between my daughter somehow it's up on the bed and it has got itself stuck between the duvet and the duvet cover so how are you what I'm here for you doing what why did you leave a rabbit alone in the bedroom and to try and get itself star  \"search for you guys this is funny the million dollar question what is your favourite dance to do all that's like asking something choose their favourite child so I'm not going to do that straight up but say that we spend most of our time doing authentic jazz dancers so we're thinking about things like Lindy Hop make and rhythm tap and we absolutely love things like blues because it's a natural extension for us and for the Dancers of the time people like Frankie Manning is a great blues dancer so there is a normal spectrum within the vernacular and just dances and to be honest the more experienced the more we find love and so on a desert island discs which dance would you take probably the Lindy Hop because this just so much in it but I think we're up to 13 or 14 different dances now so you can't really pick one easily do you when you're learning to dance is there a Kind  \"call style of dance that is quite transferable to different dances I'm just too xx thinking that is there a Celeb certain movements certain number of steps that you do that that actually transfers really well absolutely Justice with music there are parts of different musical Styles which overlap things like the blues which predates chances is built-in you can't really take out why would you want to but if it starts you on a massive spectrum of different musical experiences the same is true of jazz and specially things like the Lindy Hop influenced every other dancer came after it and soon as a dancer you see things like Suzy Q's in salsa that came from Jazz and there are hundreds and hundreds of different movements which crossover so there's a large large common area for dancing this is one of the fantastic things dance moves are often very Samsung the dance Musa named after people one of the ladies from the Savoy here it was called Susie Q seemingly and she invented the steps were you cross one foot over the other and then you found that fit out actually this may be going to dancing in the radio doodle Susie Q buy crossover when they get up on the floor baby suddenly start doing all the dances auditor do you have to say this this is this particular Savoy Style or is it just purely the music you're playing as it people instantly no absolutely with something like the live music of the bands that we choose we know that the music's going to be danceable we research he carefully We work with the bands on arrangements and timings and it's funny that within a particular genre of music people dance different things and we encourage that something like a boar and tea dances some people get up and do a quick step just something that somebody else is Lindy hopping to what doing Balboa too so we are all the dances to make their own choices about what they dance and win more about the music and me why didn't leave it alone in the bedroom right of the dead mountaineer's out there however I believe this is the consequence for children refusing to live in the 1940s postal district because you and I have an eiderdown and blankets and rabbits don't go fighting and blankets they seem to like this duvet they did and I just kind of had visions when you said about them the mountaineering rabbit of there's a scene in a film of Monty Python where there's a lot of the flying rabbit it will I guess that's kind of maybe what the rabbit was it would help you dance if it doesn't just help you can't get into the zone little story when I was first dance what are the dancers in the class in Australian by the name  \"had some really big swing trousers on the real the business and he came up to me Monday and he said Mike you said you want to get some big trousers make you said they do some of the dancing for you  \"electric yesterday yes you get extra movement that is some of the clothes so it's really nice if if your and dancing is like putting on a set of clothes already so if you're doing it took you laid on sand you addressed to the hero or in the way that you feel expresses what you're doing then that's about a real good added + is that the same for the ladies to live  \"romantic Heroes in Thailand it's so lovely for the ladies to dress as a lazy rather than jeans and a T-shirt baseball cap those lovely for the lasers to wear a dress and a flower in there  \"does people come along to the Dancers if you found that like they can I start to embrace it and then maybe by the next dance I've got a little bit more and then slowly there a most completely in the same absolutely and there are certain little things that you're off and seeing you have little smile when you see them one of the most guys with the shoes I miss a guy turn up in Charleston shooting know he's taking things seriously  \"somersault really that she wear yeah I've become much more aware since I started dancing and you know when I see you nice shoes on ladies on my way I look at those shoes things I've never thought of that before so yeah definitely and awareness raising Xperia  \"with dancing like anything you have to practice again and again and again so I'm assuming you guys run workshops classes for people to come along to take to keep practicing absolutely no Wednesday's in

insane carrier but I wasn't a massive huge fan of the storyline you simply the storyline itself was good but I'd say it was an hour and a half long the film not doing highers it did dragon cell phone and it repeated it so quite a few times I understand it repeated itself because of the actual story but it did dragons and yeah me and me and Georges found out that it's based on true is that that's true yeah that's true he got ripped to shreds by a bear ripped not once not twice but three times reasons and then it fell on I'm not going to give anymore sisters spoilers since he got up and rising spoiler alert buried buried alive then he drags himself out of the Grave with the name of broken foot for most of it as well and you somehow managed to seem so far fetched like I was expecting him to get on a hoverboard at 1 but if you just know it based on turning ago that it was just ridiculous at the same time the acting the Leonardo Zack Wallace unbelievable it's the way they can let you know certain directors I'll get his name up there in a minute I can't remember his name for certain erectors and you know make-up artist you really need to hand it to them because they can transform it's partly to do with an accident act like a canvas and it's Jay was it like you see him comparing two Wolf of Wall Street to the way he was her in the compare those two films and close to character not the characters his acting from yes I think he deserves an Oscar yeah Tom Hardy's performance was even fantastic in the same thing as the other words that Leonardo actually had to say no no it can't be any it was literally just his acting I know he was incredible everyone in there was that does not match 2nd floor I agree with you on storyline I think I'm not not the storyline of that you just yeah that's the repetitiveness if that's a word was a little bit too much to an extent where if you see someone dragging themselves across eye then it cuts away to another another scene then it cuts back and he's still doing it for 10 more minutes it can drag however the cinematography saved that a little cinematography literally I'd say probably made most of the film yeah if that was you know shot and a house and he was drunk trying to drag himself down the stairs I don't think it would be as much as a sex but it was just incredible benefits of films to watch it's a film to watch in the cinema yeah yeah I agree agree I couldn't really imagine TV know the quality women anyone is good Leo for Oscar or he deserves for The Wolf of Wall Street thought and and the Titanic michaelis and I also think and Django Unchained I think he's or he's been incredible in a lot of things but I think this is one of his best performances ever so I'd like I'd love to see beautiful I think it would be a little bit of heaven and justice if Tom Hardy gets best supporting doesn't get best actor notoriety done an incredible actor but we're not talking back to me and what did you say I liked it but the only thing I didn't like is the way it ended it was kind of just all happened so quickly and then suddenly they were just married and have a kid yeah yeah I say it doesn't really leave a lot of room at the end of think about all I wonder what happened because it just forget I feel like this movie are obviously like shooting it wasn't rush but I think the storyline wasn't I haven't read the books so it was obviously planned beforehand but it seemed rushed to an extent were you know if she fell out with Gail very very quick it was once they're gone he was only got so confused his name in real life no I don't know I won't know his name in real life but he was not Peter the other one the other one call Lillian Williams yeah yeah yeah she cut him off one see that was it even know Peter was in a cup of tea cramps Elvis at he just changed halfway through from being so aggressive and get away from me please get off me to come here I love you and then if if you went through that much trauma don't trust yourself with the little kid she had two kids with her he could snap at any point this is now that's obviously showing it way down the line from there that's what they mad I don't mean it that they look for receding hairline what would you say it was either the one I think it's clever the second one second one is good I can't remember rightly 10 San Diego second first so then for yoga for him was like so far from was actually I think it was I love the third one and the second one I don't have the third one I think it was gone I think it was a night did you notice that the tiny little with a little inkling a kind of link to a possible V film I'm going to be like this is just because out there they said at one point around a table they mumbled about another hung seems to be the goal of everyone yeah that's true but it was that round table debate whether to do another Hunger Games it Could Happen wasn't even answer properly was it wasn't asked if there was no it was like who's in favour who isn't it came to a majority vote they should but nothing happened like that you didn't see anything off  \"I think they might be there their children's generation it could be that much and that would be a whole new film thing is that the hunger games that I like the storyline of the first and the second I'm not too keen on the third and fourth kind of fish seem so much they are acts through it you can't wait he said what white what's happening now that you just get so I can see Hunger Games being bought by Disney or I really really famous deaf and then and then not Disney Disney Disney all Star Wars films and if you think about when you were a child and grill Star Wars that's what I think I think Hunger Games Willow if it is it all if it's bought by anyone will be bought by Disney and I think there be a prequel and it'll be a you and little mate how's it going  \"the wall ruin it that's my opinion I don't like before films of her intimate and it's very nice and I think they really will ruin it if there's a prequel have already have with the stars on the floor yeah I think that I think they've been pushing it before Phil you know like that the last the first one was good you could just tell the budget change between the first and the second yeah you really good thing it is it is yeah we need to move on because I've got long at all search from Star Wars have you seen Star Wars metal cable brief on it a little what do you think of that honest I thought it was really good I thought it was incredible it's one of my favourite Saturday 6 if you see me that's around 7 yeah what would you say in order in order it's been awhile since I've seen all the time yeah yeah yeah the seven that's going to more to me song was so nice out there simply because it was a hot it has it's been years since I bought out Star Wars film and the quality of it's incredible yeah J.J Abrams age is it in incredible director and you could you can tell his like a little individual style that you have going on there with with Star Wars end I can't remember the name of the guy that plays Finn it's fantastic actor um I'm going to give you a spoiler at at 6:46 that like Dead on so please please funeral or block your ears at that point ok because I'm going to get a massive massive massive spoiler um yes I think that the one play Finn is fantastic one plays razor trial radio Argos shouldn't but the girl the girl she is also fantastic why you didn't like it I wasn't a matter fact like comparing her to him I wasn't yeah I thought she was good I just think it was a very much incredible he was he was and he's got a pina directed and wrote attack the Block that sorry got famous know Han Solo and layers son right call the search for the whole believe I could take you all the every single film has had the same story line yeah I've noticed health and social eagle film which is ridiculous to it like I like I like that I like the whole running at you in running with that seem but come on we don't want any more origin stories which Star Wars has had pretty much 6 origin film news right we don't want anymore we want to see some Unique it they also I'm going really nerdy hey Michaela so please supply. These are all balanced to the Galaxy your order to the Galaxy you say no change no change it's the same they could be just like the train that has the same similar than 86 change completely like I can might not be going from the first the first trilogy right first rail Luke looking for first dad but no not know his that his dad's dad's buffet de right and it's him learning that he is his father and then turning into the light side good but Note II trilogy it's all about Anakin not not knowing is his family growing up and turning to the dark side so is all about one person that an enticing shot through their eyes and then they turn to a certain side by and then this one is clearly going to be about Finn rapes like rain or whatever her name is and solo the answer listen I can't remember 11 yeah yeah it's been so yes I don't know what else I don't know that it's different because we haven't actually seen anything from like that thing was a Stormtrooper think insurance yeah totally stunning makes a storyline incredible like a tit breaks Star Wars Wars II trilogy was it really upsets the entire sounds kind of thing were going because it will it wasn't the Star Wars they all grew up with that was it was completely different it was very it was more like saying I enjoyed that more I preferred that run games so much more attention yeah but people the Old Die Hard fans didn't like it so much but I think this series brings that back to the weight of you know the old style it's even shot in the same style that the first three minutes yeah I will good film ever going to play guess

and it says matter life it's t matters live so it's so if you want to follow us on Twitter is AT&T matters live and if you want to see what McKayla talking about a minute ago with my Snapchat story then you can follow me tool you can add me on Snapchat is dry Elliot no capital letters right Elliot capital having a double l n double t and a milton going to talk about the Oscars this is controversial very controversial and controversial because a lot of the nominations are that meeting the majority then the white the White do you think that that is I mean do you think the Academy of genuinely said right that we want every nomination to be for white no I don't know I don't listen to Stupid if you think like around the amount I mean the only film that I can sync with that does not two of three films this year that have really stood out that have been the majority um not not white people and that is ride along to that that that came out this year I can't remember the name of it it had who is Straight Outta Compton straight out of Compton and they were the only ones so far that I can think of but I don't think that there was any purpose for a reason that they may haven't been nominated I mean what European didn't get nominated movies you want it's very very nice it's not even though it's not saying like black people aren't as good with the most specific roles and no specific films like they weren't as good as him that was the film icity is wrong in my opinion I think of something to blame it something to blame but I didn't win because I'm blah blah blah it's wrong that's not the reason it's because there was someone out there better than MK Dons are through to the semi fourth round of the FA Cup's they played Northampton what was the score George personal 3 milton who they are playing Chelsea in the next round up there yes yes and if I get through that will be playing yes that's different film let me know no one Will Smith isn't an incredible actor he is Morgan Freeman Samuel Jackson they're all incredible actors booked for this category they're not they haven't done anything substantial enough to get will it just basically something about it they haven't done what the people who have been nominated have done to get yeah because obviously because I've been nominated that deserve there is not anything to do with ethnicity is it confusing today released but I think we might be here now actually  \"it's confusing but I mean it obviously as you said Will Smith isn't going to be attending the Oscars either and it's a shame because you know you think that they would still support their fellow actors let me put it as an excuse not to go it's a bit less controversial and a lot more fun Mickey Finn has spent the week looking at the most popular passwords 2015 would you like to go through some and not that's sad everyone I don't spend the whole week I just read it I feel like I'm not even 5 and she's tired she when she says she want the bed

I think you use in order to achieve success I think you have to let me have a number of blocks of effort if you can build base box up that's great but once you've got them everything will try to take them away from you when you had your bits to keep them agree with I think that thing about volunteering different job  \"and probably try and you know we might get quicker to position will be fine what works for us a missing to Terry story of what an incredible career sizing  \"no I mean it's just been a tough life and I'm not the only one with already you know and you know that's what creates the person we become what I mean I'm sure it'll 63 6 64 yeah so really are retiring almost but I won't return your damn of the day 17th I know that you know  \"Samsung 17 is looking for another volunteers got you already have to say morning to the world events I'm a stem ambassador I am heavily involved milton keynes when getting all these requests that I almost feel guilty for working 10 things I will need volunteers is once you start to enjoy it does become a bug you really do start spray with work does tend to get a bit dry and a bit dull anbesol was supposed to mentor a really but I'll take a little bit more of an active role in it because I think they appreciate that even more the fact that you're prepared to help them very much I mean there's some people that listen to me with no I do a lot of fun too as well um including sitting in this yet it says you've been doing international charity will be here at some point and the digital pinnacle of their program is a company programme when they go onto to create a genuine company in September they tried that through to July and it's it's it's something up on the Wii really very good at in milton Keynes it has to be they do incredibly well as teens punch fight about their work is it all the time with just goes to reflect milton Keynes as as a sort of coal really as I think is a composite as a town town city town this town at the lido Bristol even surprised by the people that you've met enough you would not believe how bright these children or kids in ages are um I was quite shocked because I actually understand business more than we realise um I might not know the actual principles but once you giving the Year the leading edge if you like yeah they're in there like a shot never lets his school work with it's just a natural because some of them a good present in some are good at maths you know and do the accounts because we split up into they will have roles to do you know as far as managing director and all that sort of thing and some people play apart really well if they don't have 2nd would you have to encourage the team exactly but this is the last thing I was quite right to actually in front grill Casa beans what you expected know if I have on someone this no good behaviour levels have been x there's always one maybe two that was usually me that has to have to be sent yesterday piano yt

sorry that you have to push and because the deadlines are a very a very  \"sweat yes and um you know I suppose that meant to be that way but you know you can push and you can push and and Nate date they don't fight back I actually get on with it and I have been absolutely amazed by the standard of the girls and the boys in fact I have to sit the boys and the girls will seem to come out on top DOTA 2 teams that that I work with that go on to do they wear with it milton Keynes have no connection with both been all female team sorry Ryan if you listening I didn't mean that I must say that the first team wasn't all female we did have one male member who were not only stepped into the team he was kidnapped women a year below so it from here below he ended up in managing the team I think this

giants I've got a couple things coming up at Campbell Park in the not too distant future calls with the rugby coming in October so much going on Saturday 11th the little Horwood Village Fete dog show  \"patient grants Church Street little Horwood they will be there from good afternoon and welcome to transitions and need to meet Dave Simpson live on Secklow sounds with me today is her agent Michael Terry Collins I hate Aries from Mk like at the moment and we will be discussing volunteering from the selective hearing and why do it community I want to look vauxhall's coconut so they say bouncy castles so if you've got nothing to do with a little light just enjoy the sunshine something really nice but fully face than you think I like to say I've been to that one before and it is a real cracker this is typical Village Fete is always something going on 30 worth worth of that I remember going to peppers in spaniola not sure I think this one is it however it's at the centre of it didn't quite girl things and then we were harmful to the group full scan but now they're not really random but it was a florin best thing and where they put us we're in with the bucks Fire Brigade as part of their road safety and all the rest and we couldn't been further the Croft is playing field which was rapidly turning into a swap so yeah it was we were soaked to the bone but it was it was good fun sounds of you haven't got a pen the little Horwood Village Fete dog show classic car show everything you did want from a proper village fete and that will be on there in Church Street Liverpool with the Recreation Ground there from 2 p.m. this weekend there's a lot of other stuff coming on we have so I'm sure most of you seen in the press we have someone for David Dickinson coming to town this weekend we have the duke in town doing his Hooves TV recording um and we've been lucky enough for Terry form from one of the other shows from the sticks has managed to grab an interview with David I'm doing a couple of minutes will be going to the perfect error while you're out and about doing your your volunteer aside from the the kids and you get to meet any other people over a range of other volunteers yeah yeah because obviously you're not on your own when you go to a school and there's normally about 70 other people doing different classes um so you get to meet other business people like yourself summary tired and just do the volunteer work and there it is a good place to meet people doing the same thing and and enjoying the same thing that thank you do cuz I knew it was you make a lot of teachers are very good that they're very sorta proactive in what we do and which is obviously very good you know because her without their help sometimes it could be a little bit you know what's going on to develop Thursday afternoon and Connor point to some weight two hours going to say have you gone on to have any other relationships in any sort of business opportunities with a min there was a couple of firm a couple of the Year the group that I've been shown or has come up with some really good ideas and there are said that I'll tell from father and forever hopefully some of them are you know some of the children or kids teenagers whatever you wanna call them don't wanna carry on I was thinking the volunteers over munch oh yeah yeah yeah witcher 3 years ago now it's important and then must have been 40 volunteers that you need with networking event for years when there are that many people there so much having like-minded people in the same place is ultimately why we go networking go instead of the next networking meeting you want to go to might be considered would you recommend um I would personally because I think it gives you her it gives you something that you can't get anywhere else you don't no matter what you do within your business you can't get the pleasure small boys maleficent and why do people volunteer what's what's in it for the Volunteer what do we get out of it do you get from seeing these students and also being yeah being so young and I think some of them are actually surprised about a good day actually are what they do they do it without thinking yes wonderful you know it's not that I don't have to sit after problem the ones you sit down and think about it other ones that normally don't work you do you know if you were at one of these events volunteers mentioned something out for dinner maybe without the Education would you consider going into that just because it's tough to know it's not know I like to help people when it's it's a natural birth of my whole life and I always like to help people when things like you know of I've made managers have some more stuff of thought map to manage it again that's another thing without you not volunteering it you are on your way because you're going over it up absolutely fine I'll go that little bit further with Intuit to encourage and to take on bigger roles um so although it's not volunteering the Saatchi it's just it's a similar time it's going that bitch going that way going that extra mile for her to give some You're Something to someone who I think that is a good moral for anybody to to go by is a fantastic thing to do now as I mentioned a few minutes ago we've got the to Dixon coming to town Saturday I believe this weekend Stantonbury Leisure I'm not going to fill you in with the details there's always that I haven't spoken to David Terry did so he's a bit over Dickinson is it tonight a full interview answers on for about 10 minutes um but we are here we will be back the show is about transition it's about overcoming problems it's about learning of soft skills of life I'm not being beaten understanding what it takes to be successful now when I originally agreed to tell you that I played this love to sit down bit bit my giddy up a little bit I took up the junction because you know he needs to fix the shower on plane I'll listen to it I'm quite a mate's actually I'm should I say you don't know anything but David's history, milton tell about that now but the back welcome back to those who been listening hello today is having weird it's not good enough we now enjoying the studio we have we have Tom and Jerry in this year you don't know Tom Bulman from work try another organisation absolutely fantastic when I'm pleased to serve them a few things it's going to the end of the school year so actually we require and down and terms of delivery but were planning big for next year with getting up our workout sessions where you get guests in a room asking questions about the job from 30 kids and begin to be doing 150 of those over the next year but that's a lot but you can see that you still just Milton Keynes all you expand your reach surely deliver in milton Keynes but increasingly we're going outside to trainee teachers and cruise advisors in other Boroughs to use some of the techniques that we've learnt about over the last 20 years fantastic I've been them lucky enough to do a few events with work tree um so good missing Shannon yeah I think we get a lot when I person again hello night out of it it's it's giving something back after working over 45 years in my own business and her it's about giving something back to other people especially did teenagers of today because that's what I hear after morning up kids the teenagers for 40 years of age the ones I deal with any way and that I have a lot of fun very warm  \"making smaller the conversations and so small ratios where the guest is interviewed by a very small group of students I didn't know more than 4 and what we find is that compared with the big speaker presentations so speaking to assemblies or been asked to do mentoring over extended period and having a kid and work experience for two weeks all of which is great stuff but actually it's quite demanding of the Honest company an employer on the employee and what's good about the crew workout sessions is it is very latest one hour no preparation walking answer questions for account please do not have to say um I've done that one I expected of reason to not have any complicated all the questions how wrong was I but then I really do that I'm Interiors saying earlier that he gets stuck in with the tough questions and they will get the answers that is great I think the vital thing is that we find a way to get into freedom to ask what they want doesn't mean we can always giving clear answer call centre can't always get everyone to talk about just giving the student about work is fine and they are quite interesting why do you do what do you like about how did you get into that is not very very interesting I like the one who sings really really really funny games that they play home love you looking for some full of absolutely frantic volunteering that once great if you can spare an hour  \"desecrate spent an hour that is not perfect if 130 work as gifts 1 hour to doing this every single student will meet 50 people believe before they leave school and some of these tunes definitely a long period of some of them very community base that we don't get access to the office  \"phone number 20 99 40 x reader August the website information about places and I really just eat it to have a go at doing it and then we cover for the talk about what impact is actually having a fantastic um speak milton Tom in a few minutes while you were running around answer the door for me navigate that members of the Self Indulgence which area did you do that even if I did like sounds like today talking all things volunteering was just saying you in about me something mouth hurts the key to do volunteering in an assembly that live on tonight I really do ticketogo if you can't do that message, go with his program I'm going to drop you in it because I always thought you might have Terry has a we got married the duke on the radio and a very own dog sitting in the studio would you like to set your background get an idea of the diversity of people well basically has started off as a mechanic ended up owning my own haulage company and then I sold everything up to go into an off-licence and I've sold net curtains as well but in 2004 I think was the biggest term for me was that the biggest thing that has ever done in my life um I started a sport called drifting and no one will not Many of Her About It um not many tracks should heard it so I couldn't put it on in certain places because this gig in the Two Towers made the wages but we started on Wednesday in them it was the federated notes yeah it was a February 2004  \"Mr Deeds no not telling centre the other side of Fear sorry about this obviously we have a cracking day and got photographers down there who came without asking as me saying what you doing you told you could come on it I will let in dnd actually said that one of the best mates I've ever known but there you go and anyway I started drifting I'm up put the first competition on Birmingham Wheels we had all the top line styles from Japan come over from the day one with the shorter gurus of drifting and we started out with a loved one there  \"from there to greatness within five years we've grown to be quite a big organisation evaluate their own TV show um and zu and it's just a great I look forward to every time I didn't first time I've got was because I've got walking into a warzone sometimes all you think it is actually it's not the kids a great of teenagers a great but you have to earn their respect eventually we called it The bdc which was the best British drift championship which is still running today although I don't have nothing to do it now because it will be out that are stuck to a five year plan and I domestic strategy which I use um and everything when calling to plan well so what so you can't get everything to call the plan but and since then I've started MK local how to rid of Internet marketing affiliate marketing online marketing and obviously any local register business directory that go to work that's all days roughly so I tried to give something back for next time you're you're you're sitting in the classroom and there's a volunteer from you may be talking to to somebody report trusted to milton Keynes but thought drift into the UK UK ago McLean I'm just thinking about volunteer work what's the best thing for

it developing in there call Millie is he said I mean it that sells themselves fall under that the distribution district commissioner streaming in the sensor to let that person is need to make sure that the gsl Z I get into the necessary information and whether that be fine this district commissioner giving it to the DVDs of the ADC or whether he holds general meetings all that person sorry I

district exec now overseas like any other group excetra we do have a District exec with a District share this a treasurer and difference secretary BT and we also have representations from the other groups hopefully and hopefully from other parents Sur also in scouting like a basic like a group basically get me with formula that and the role of the districts make sure that district is going alright directions to support the Adidas ace ABC success to make sure that all the groups have the right information to hand has the right information may be for census that was just do it first thing Cause every year so make sure that any money that is owed for anybody use any that has bought accept things like that small an admin role in making sure that the camps are within budget and it's like that it's very is still very clear oh yes it is and they will sit across to the point yes and appointments committee so whenever we have a new leader during the district they have to attend what we call and appointments committee know a lot of people see it as early as like an interview but it's it's not meant to be in that way at all and it's basically to make sure that you are aware of the role that you're taking up and that the person that spin mould you into this role and giving you all the necessary information hasn't told you something that is not quite the truth and and it's just to make sure that you're happy and you're committed to the role and it's not a job interview and it milton I've been known milton happening I very rarely seen where we've had to say yeah I think most people hopefully groups well as us as we discussed I would do their own recruiting um but we are just another point of checking that you say just to make sure that the person has been understand the rules regulations for the scout Association understands their role if they're not in the right role for any reason a baby comes out of the conversation then I was sick yesterday, social happy had with with them and also the gsl to make sure they are and I was leaving from the bout some other local local ways of communicating xx like Facebook hand and all the face having a District a year and then obviously it's a great chance to actually meet the local training manager video ever that person is within that role he's usually at these meetings and their yeah they can they can talk to them about the training and and how the training runs and when you should have certain things done by in and all of those clothes things said and the usually have fun I'm all have been happening previous in the first Monday that start classes in our district yeah but obviously the other dishes may have a different way of overdoing it buttons are we we we we we try that hold us over first man in the moon you at least I tried to get because of the appointments committee also do review MBA group scout leader I have to review your role every three to five make sure that you're in the right role it's like a like a like a review process you have basically just make sure that you are happy you doing your training is going ahead if you're in the help and make sure you're in the right role if you want to change I know those reviews then have to go to the appointments committee and they don't have to have a look at those see if there's anything else that they need to do or avoid anything and then they then set another period of time and it's 35 years whenever before the next review if there's anything there with a suspicious person and then go from there so it's just is a review process make sure if it's happy and was going on it and I think now we we we tend to move on to a toucan I'm just very briefly and the county of Chic and sister of leaders as well and sound like a deceased air

executive committee cities of the people that sit behind the group and actually do all of the finance um all of the nitty gritty bits that have to go on behind the scenes and to make sure that the groupies is financially stable and being able to run and to this is if they are very important people and they don't usually get enough recognition of those things I don't know about you Gary but I don't feel that the group executives Get Enough recognition sometimes for the the roles that they do seem like everyone asks for a secretary of a charity  \"show all being a parent rep the other people don't know what these roles are thinking  \"buy an easy task list in Outlook tasks you have been put into the group you need to make sure as you said to the groupies got enough money to pay the

don't have to be there every what you are listening to milton Keynes scout radio here on your Secklow sounds on your Monday evening show with myself Jason and Gary and me and you they were talking about everything scouting this evening and am really weird touching on the exact so the roles within the executive committee chairman treasurer you have executive members also your secretary falls into the exact as well and obviously your group scout leader and should also attend the group executive committee me am i d d you can't have any of your group leaders I'm on your executive committee um but it has been known to have and that it said there's no such strict rule in but ideally you don't really want them on their own because it can be seen as or as a conflict of interest and I can be a little bit difficult sometimes and to deal with situations that there might need to be discussed in in the executive committee if the group leaders are there um and obviously the gsl is is the point of contact for the leaders at the groups from those meetings I know I know but some groups I can't get away from it better to small letters starting off exception but so that they can go to the leaders can go to the exec they can get invited to dinner after come in ex ex ex is stopping them but I just say it's a fire very busy people anyway yeah I'm so let leaders lead and it exec basically to do their bit last the two separate things I like you just remind yourself to 224 around and die head of stuff Walsall sorts of that here just do do your role your leadership role where you're looking after your sectional weather then and then the the next roll up from that really is an occasional helper Cisco question can my mum be a parent helper I think you are so right yet so you want to be a parent you want to get involved in any way after this evening if contact is enough Facebook page milton Keynes scout radio and to the next role that would be an occasional helper which is a slightly more involved you you would ideally need to be there every week make sure about the boat people doing lately try and say after you that you probably move on now to the district team you do after One Direction in history police committed role of a good word IT support role yes it is supporting the US section whatever you're doing so if your District Scout Leader presents your support in the lake district scouts yet basically sales support role YouView get more involved in the actual planning of the evenings and stuff like that yeah yeah yeah parents evening there to help and occasional helper um yeah it be nice to get out of every year every week but obviously person around that can be out with the go to Alton out to forget the ratios correct when you go to camp or extra pair of hands that can't believe it's cooking or or or or or or I'm doing some of the entertainer in Northern France with the bases accept track video so yeah obviously  \"baby support in all of the Scout troops making sure you're there for them when they need you and it says short and leaders or anything like that you likely to be sorted into help out for a little while poem and you would also be supporting your the ADC for that section and that's for the next roll up is the ADC we have a D&C beavers ADC cubs ADC scouts I think I think im.in is scouting little very much into the abbreviations I think I am a B flat sounds for assistant district commissioner it does say you got assistant district commissioner for beavers as you say cubs and Scouts at the moment mean a DC is all seaweed we just we will sort of things up to make it if it be easier really like it so much of amount of litter you have what we call a desk which is a District Explorer scout commissioner and that  \"CESC that's why we say desk and they look after older of the Explorer scout units and with industry what are the age groups they got the new start from 5 and a half to 6 depending on the groups and depends on how they get away to listen to get in except after 8:35 half and 68 are you late at 8 they go to cubs play DLC there's a link up anyway there's some sort of an OB please go out with us and the link up process they don't just go on the 8th birthday stop going to the papers and they're going to come because we have a look the new haircut your cub Scout until you're about 10 and a half 11

their units ok we've got 4 4444 units in milton Keynes at the moment um and yeah it's over anybody that holds count in that might be listening and is used to be what we call Venture Scouts at the time and then just gets used to run from 14 up to 25 or 20 years some like that, member the exact but it's big big long range yes that is to Run 2 so um unfortunately Venture Scouts Scotland zazzle posters olds need to be DBS checked they do yes they will need to go for a DBS check with Cisco Association will have to pay for it so you don't need to wear if you come with us to the DBS um it doesn't mean that you automatically will go through without going for a DBS you have to go for another DBS on 4chan me and let us get us a section post about this position in her 70 is that a yes and dragging a 14-year-old into a couple of accessories is very it's not good not good practice in learning was always you encourage you suffer with iPhone case that so basically they split the section up yes I got explorers and yeah and then that leaves of just one know which is the district commissioner and the district commissioner basically is the it is a somebody just with her with her that I and I mean every other see each District mission is very different depending on what and that they the main role is to make sure that the dishes anorexia collect pigeon types of DBS yes don't know that we

started to have more confidence in myself then I suppose that's why I started to feel well maybe this is something that I could do just after Lancaster you you have you got your degree and you then went to Bretton Hall College that's right that was at Bretton Hall College was Dennis specialist drama College the work that many special drama cop specialist drama colleges outside London I did did did you have to do anything past exams and things to get into the woods at Bretton Hall was there an audition is unlike any other kind of thing I don't like a proper interview they were interview but

\"well I trained as a drama teacher and I was fortunate to get a drama teaching job in another lovely area this thing this is a film with me in it I wanted to be in beautiful places and I went down to West Dorset which is a great part of Britain and I took drama for three years in a lovely rural Comprehensive School in a town called bannister and I enjoyed that I meant to be had a great time there even though I felt I was doing quite a good job and I enjoyed working with that young people that I worked with um wondered all the time I was wondering whether I really had it in me to do some performing myself and after 3 years reference to school with no job to go to incredible to think of it now given the state of our economy now that what I wished that was this play has had rave reviews around the world and in 2007 received the Olivier Award for comedy and in 2008 to Tonia but 1979 something like that the film Billy Elliot which is about the lad who wants to be a dancer who lives lives there in the north east in a coal mining area it was that place around getting there together to perform a play that was about their experiences it was based on their experiences of how they kept the community together during this very stressful strike I'm sure we can talk for hours on this message Excel home but I'd like to move on to talk about to North Country Theatre but before we do that if we can have your next track yeah and a track from an American blues guitarists called JJ Cale JJ Cale is what you make of country blues artists the reason I chose it I don't really know how I discovered it suddenly he was my favourite musician and I listen to me all the time I need to one of the few musicians and this track that I've chosen riding home is one that I listen to over and over again 30 years after I first bought the LP I still play this track quite often I've got it on my iPad now and then when I have it on there a long playing record 30th or 2 years ago listen to J J Cale

Theatre a few years late nothing can also be seen parading around places such as Fountains Abbey Vets as a monk or cutting grass into the shape of the maze and then reciting pi actually I had about three or four years of being a freelance director and Drama worker and then I work for Harrogate Theatre and I kept my interest in education and I got a job as director of theatre in education which meant that I was doing  \"I was halfway house between what they're done before I am what I wanted to do I was still working in school still working with young people but I was doing much more performance based work so I sent a great year so they say at Harrogate Theatre and I do a really good time there but I wanted always have suppose in the back of my mind with the idea that I wanted to for my own theatre company and I reached an age can we actually talk about it be about 40 something now and I suddenly thought if I don't get on with this I might be too late I might suddenly lose the energy for doing it of course that's a bit like what I said about leaving the teaching job if I don't try it I'll never know so I gave up again they gave up my job at Harrogate Theatre  \"where was there a regular paid such a person and launch back into freelance work um and I formed a company called and we call the North Country Theatre Chris we wanted to perform in rural areas in the country but mostly in the north of England term particularly around North Yorkshire where I now live and it was started with a very small two and a £1,000 grant from the Arts Council which just about cupboard 3 weeks of rehearsal kept for others are employees with that money and then we had to earn money from selling tickets and they're selling the show and unfortunately we got off to a really good stuff  \"North Country Theatre has now been running for a 17 years that pretty good Grips compact for a small scale company to survive that long is pretty good going and it's Sam still popular we we pretty much perform in small theatres and Arts centres and Village halls and community centres places but I'm not really like professional venues I took own but the very first thing that knows the thing that launched North Country Theatre it was an adaptation of a very famous thriller called The 39 Steps I've got an idea that it could be done with a very small number of people partly because the whole story is about people disguising themselves and pretending to be somebody there not and I also had this kind of joke ideas that's all the scenery could be done with set  \"step ladders for The 39 Steps using 39 steps and steps and them  \"secret brilliantly we came to the mall red and we had a Big Mac of Britain as the backdrop and it was a very successful adaptation and a few years after we done it we got asked to show us script to a theatre in Scotland and they liked it and they do this much bigger Theatre Perth theatre in Scotland and then turn back to the London producers to come and see it and then the London produce they liked it and took it on what's called the commercials tore and then eventually he passed the right song to another produced every works it and eventually produced it into a West End hit and not only was at West End hit which is still running it formed all over the world  \"run on brought off Broadway Here in New York and have won awards there as well it was Olivia any awards in in Britain so it started off in Village halls in North Yorkshire and ended up being performed off Broadway and on in the West End of London next coming to your next track I recently had my 60th birthday and I went to see the leader of this banding in concert but first hurting when I was in my Twenties and it's a bank was Talking Heads an American band and this is a track called the big Country Talking Heads of a kind of slightly concave suppose in those days band led by Michael David Byrne and big country is track 11 aside two of the second Talking Heads 1978 album more Songs about Buildings and Food the albums one single cover of the Al Green hit take me to the river peaked at number 26 on the pop singles chart in 1979 I don't want to ask Nobby about how he met his wife well um I was the fortunate episode when I move to the north east like I mentioned earlier and it was only temporarily a bit of a lonely time for you because I was I didn't know anybody and I was in this very different industrial community and I was asked to go and do a radio comma I was invited to Crystal local radio station was just round the corner from the Arts Center I worked at and the person who was producing that voice over was a lady who was to become my wife and that's where I met her for the first time and before we Delve into any of that I Began by asking Notley about going up in industrial South Yorkshire in the 90s I talked a lot about my career the things I've done and what I've achieved and so on but I think if you're lucky enough to have a partner who supports you in that kind of thing I'm executor difference if heat the work that I was doing a lot of the time the theatre is not on incredibly well paid job and especially when you're working freelance which I did for a lot of years you get a bit of work here in a bit of work there and it really is hard to make a living in the theatre where I got married I was lucky enough to be able to share my life and the difficulties in the financial struggle with somebody and actually over the years  \"we kind of taking it in turns my wife Jill and I've taken it in turns to take risks when I've had a bit of a paid job she's taking a risk and done something that you wanted to do when she has a regular secure job she's giving me the threesome to take those risks that you've heard me talk about before and chips to go out for me and who knows that was going to work we didn't know at the time I get to the many wives you wouldn't look back in horror house that you're going to do what yeah yeah and then back she gave me that kind of wrong to say gave me permission but she made it possible I suppose we were not blessed with children unfortunately we were that was something there didn't happen for us and I suppose you know there's a downside to that terrible downside to it but there's also  \"castle mound of freezing that comes from that we didn't have the responsibility of little children to worry about so we had a certain amount of freedom to take risks that perhaps a family that had children just couldn't have done so um I'll try to see the positive side of it I'm not saying I would love would like to have children with both would have liked it had children but that didn't work out for it but they have been some compensation um and it's still going on now where we are with 60 years old and where we're still kind of Supporting each other in the different things that we do so I think that I've been incredibly lucky in that respect to find somebody who would put up with the kind life style that kind of a little bit insecure and  \"yeah I know I know I know Jill was the pivotal when you have some bad news 24 years ago when the Arts Council said they were going to remove the funding that was there helping North Country theatre in I've got these wonderful Productions together I know that was a major shots but at the time it yourself and you know it could have been the end of North Country but you were decided that you'll know it when she was just too good thing to lose just because there's no funding for that there is a good story which regular funding couldn't understand it done everything that we could do to fill the Arts Council aims and objectives but for whatever reason they cut funding the regular funding and it was Jill really who roll their sleeves up metaphorically and got stuck into fundraising when people think about Yorkshire especially people down south they often think of it as they're the dark satanic Mills that the industrial North

white steak another name for a wee featured back in the year one of the early series but this was them from a period when they're there their they're for Epic reinventions of her they were previously a pretty traditional classic rock blues bass they are actually hear this track in particular was that you mention the Led Zeppelin implements f yeah it was definitely Robert Plant mon about this one Fareham came out 1987 of the M62 that's when I start to get quite good so personal choice for me and yeah great memories I'm just checking with a contract I think that is allowed if you're absolutely and the connoisseur of the shred it I will know the name or the other can we continue with the Education on for those about to rock out of it woke up in a toilet is overflowing must call the plumber realise the kids need a swimming lessons I've still got out of control luck with your winners gave out so we'll smoke it outside must get onto the glazers am now the garden looks atrocious and what was the number for that landscaper because you never know when a potential customer needs you get yourself listed in your local flyer the local business directory your local flyer bringing businesses to your finger those about to rock hi this is Russell home with Owen Edwards and way back to LA for a next David Lee Roth the man whose arm was was an icon is massive in the States but equally he was also very small seeing you never knew where I was going to go to Vegas world or continue on in the ro that's the way these guys with China market it was on the record companies realise that if you could get some sort of pop commerciality and horrible Factor to the songs in expanded it's obviously but also keep playing same guitar then you get all those emails guitarists and fans away is the next track your next band that's Europe and this track is called superstitious and from the 1988 album out and we're going to need UK shin of series I think we can have something that maybe some most of you've got her before and apparently it's because the guitarist on Final Countdown isn't the same search for The Final Countdown was was John norum who it works uh last week guy playing on this album and this track recycle keep my 1000 remains for this day greatest rock guitarists I've ever and when he came out with it with the album eating a smile I went to a concert in October 88 but anyway it was Lita Ford and Europe I think was at the end and for the very first night this guy's absolutely blue me and all melodic but insane eat everything brilliant as well I love this guy keep my cello but there another band will kill by crunch that's a story um and uh a story actually that is pertinent to the next track and this is a m bancal winger and this was released also in I also had all the shops of all the other shredders Amanda you need some approach to it as a personality is life and life as well 16 later years and is also very young I think it's 18:19 as well so it really wasn't. was on Hilda Dan and I don't think it's ever been like that since Mum nowadays age doesn't seem to matter as much you got guys hitting the spot like their thirties and forties but this was an example that use energy aggression yeah it's great I'm a great guitar still to come you're waiting for those about to rock that's after this meeting everywhere in the world for those about to rock climb Russell home with Owen Edwards I'm looking at some of the great guitarists the great shredders of all time in this part of a series and their own and other bands that we've got now that I've not heard of before giant yeah this is bansal giant and then we'd really coming to the tail end of the 80s now this came out in August 89 and the giant or a band featuring down and a half and a number of other guys who were sort of like a modern 80s mid eighty's answer to toto these girls with a creme de le Creme of the session well Andrew point Malmsteen did well I mean it wasn't as big as a mini biography suddenly for some reason all the music fancy desserts of the rich man they couldn't sell anything out and promoters wouldn't have without their stuff I'm lucky enough Dan Harford had said he had them and they played with Madonna and David Lowe anthem for heater went to an area of the industry that was seem to actually pick up from where you are or our orientated rock and let it Rock left off and then you can choose and because he's and his amazing versatile know anybody had all Day Shred stuff and all the Rock stuff from the commercial speaker can deliver pre match please also become a massive producer to this day so yeah the great Burns and great example first saw the final Sword of moments of which types of a legit lead to a little bit to the final but I think probably the last band to actually made it in this eighties and we're just living in 219 where is Banks Ford extreme and the fish was there one of their breakout songs and actually something really big in the UK um and you sort of fat in a funky hot lots of elements they all came together and lots of musicality um and yeah it was good memories I think it was summer melodic rock and sole affair in a hair metals last gasp really blessed funny aerosol what is a great example of mixing almost sort of foreign and rainbow S-Type commercial courses with her enough guitar there to keep the guitar sounds happy yet bringing them or radio friendly audiences and that 2 if we're looking at the last of the three shows when I've been looking at the guitar starting with that sort of extreme on my self indulgent playing that was all over the place pushing the boundaries and I we've got all the way through to a sort of moron melodic pop almost accepted another guy was at his peak but I understand there was there a pretty significant incident for him that may be changed it's playing we always look at Mum's saying something firm before and after this trilogy out I mean after the trilogy album was when he had his car crash he came out with the finkels Odyssey which which was a really big hair for him and if it again rainbow collection had an extra rainbows I'm with him but he's playing I think changed forever not solely for the better um is another example of this this little honeymoon Goldilocks sort period may guitarist so in the mid Twenties that everything is correct and then something happened to Mum has Katie had a car crash maybe this thing in that way but he definitely " .

have a physical medium you can just be sent the Chancery the Easter remarkable so uh you know if that works for you but anyway we love you to hear it and that's what you think so I do how to use in progress the sense that you do I think we have favourite songs that we can recommend world of the arrangements for all of the arrangements but then we can recommend something at the moment we can offer you x world countries that the musical Estate energetic and fresh so he's hitting a lot of a lot of need to help his girlfriend with the bells azonto at the moment it's got lots of writing songs with and always stays kind of beat the last thing you want to do is find a style that what you know the tune so well well no it should be this work expense the listeners we decided after Harry several weeks ago tried to set fire to the house by setting fire to a bird's nest that we should probably sweep the chimney again so I went the brushes and I can't hear all the stuff crashing down you not playing number this is for energy so world's always updating the pad that we play off with new tracks which means that you know I'll be a second I'm coming sooner rather than later it was good dua for when you performing because you do a lot of energy how do you get over those days where you just kind of pizza or something happened in your life and you're just like that I really can't be doing only one person has a bad day movie trailers it's your room for error you know at least one person to have a good day but normally people get you through but actually no my thing as musician you live in the moment and the matter how you feel off stage II get on stage you somehow seem to find the energy field of the adrenaline and naps and coffee destiny help fill in the gaps got the kind of pre kick routine that we go through and we will know what I'm really thinking will tell you he's just so it is it is fun having a comedy I've seen the same faces in 1980 the music Village  \"new venture love with each other um when you make mistakes as well because I know you're all Hound perfectionist musicians but I'm sure now and again this will it log note that goes alright how do you do you pick that up as your profession yeah we buy cattle prod have your certificates are and what we do is basically I just give those guys we're all wired up to on stage and it's on a foot pedal so you can just give a little guy next to you a little bit lonely Little Shop um but then also we do the dark every musician a pound for every mistake they make so I basically nowhere  \"make sure you have been too big header is remarkable minis guys have studied music and are really I'm so 18 olds play with them because actually you know what's said I don't make mistakes we don't really make mistakes you in here sometimes with tighter sometimes the more driving and it's more often when something's really cooking and that is actually wear for any musician here sometimes you just have one tune all you can eat bars and some why use gowipe that was actually cooking like a unit you know and it's more less than it states that there is more than moment of greatness really fun when is really on it Harry Blessing was getting a bit passed out so I said to Harry Ginny what do you want me to have a girl on cool with if I can do this not that I can see what goes wrong it's about appreciating when I go to my think it's there do you ever get rid of nervous before going onstage or or do you do it so regularly now that that you do so just walk out there and then go for it now a days I feel confident with basically every Giggs out there a few we did at the start of Bob Evans boys question when a regular time to pay for the albert hall with paying for childcare Trafalgar Square and I think it's not even if so the size of the audience it's just you know The Prestige of the Venue if you're playing at Royal Albert Hall I think you expect the expectation of the audience for it to be world class and you just look at the Giants of pay don't think that's what those waiting to hear that was slightly nerve wracking would generally speaking now with a constant would we do we play together online I don't know what we're doing and I think we also Compton it stands in other as a good product where ever it  \"love me or leave me alone you won't believe me but I love only I love you so much my mother and I just wanna let that someone is high in sounds that I don't love nobody  \"Love Me or Leave Me Let Me Be Lonely you won't believe me but I love you only had rather be lonely than happy with somebody else  \"what is funny because I had a band are it down in Portsmouth and I was I was really surprised when any way to cut a very long story short um simpson guys are really into jazz up pool to go ban invite me to play drums and sing for them and they have no horns and I song with trumpet sax what's this moment guitar piano drums and and and vocals and guitar and I've never really heard guitar in that context before the guitar is a guy called Mark Tottenham and I heard as on your way ok it works and that summer has struck with your pardon the pun has struck a chord with me are you with me  \"om band at unit might my stars in how was ok I love the sound of guitar is such a versatile instrument is such a modern instruments for the forties to you know it's a sound which was around but you know we do think of trumpets sac size of the fence was kind of innovative vintage and then love you now and again just say this whole world Lenovo Guitar bass tabs so then we form the bedroom but that's how it happened I found peace through a friend of his actually who you are who couldn't play a gig and said I know this guy Peter Elliott is a bit crazy talks a lot  \"do you know he was right basically that was never got rid of incensed um so it's so we're stuck with him and Mrs Edward barbers possibly the best network in Herne in London for getting gigs easy easy's everywhere and so I looked him up and the uninvited and supply in the rest is history so at that point is there a point where you start playing together anything actually this feels really right as a group and a new kind of colour so what goes the rod and down then and you have to put your hands up the chimney to get the rod quite far out something landed on my hand twitch I squealed and that was a very very good for me because I'm not to go down but it's just a bit of mice and some fluffy feathers but a freak me am I driving whilst trying to find a formula with players and it we had not that they were good enough it wasn't really there voice who are playing in the chair with him and he directed do you want to hear voices in sounds and then I think when we play we play their first gig and I was addicted to playing in front of a full kokoso income don't like talking to people first get together with no rehearsal and it just sits at in quite nicely and then actually the gig that you were huge like big yep when your lango anyway were at the Festival of vintage and it's a cracking event here at York where was really just for us traitor within a few months so we can we don't really have a choice in terms of we had bookings in the diary how to get it done so we just we played it and it works straight away I think from work perspective once you found a formula player that works he wasn't going to change it again and it's nice for him to have settled a nice to have the regular work work on a project right now it's a good project you know I know that everything is going to be a good gay m and have slight kind of that amount of playing on a guaranteed with wind what is this the future for the Bevin boys what's your plans for well you know I really I just wanna say this the guys quite often that she might my aim is really Tryin is sounds really like a bold step when I say nothing else with the radio said I really want to become a name in inches that's what I really like guess I loved on the bed indicate the start of the season and why we have their young Harry visit around with the she wasn't young Harry Redknapp I'm getting confused it was you was an idiot visit around with the microphone and recorder some interviews to really give you guys an indication about what goes on at the Festival of vintage and after this track your hair Claire who has founded 20th century chap.com NE12 here and go you know that's good music I would like to go on  \"and then second album III IV V United love that I'd love to have a journey and a body of work and see where it can involve because

regularly as well once a week it seems it looks quite a lot like he's there was 1 million but a lot of obviously kicking his last video of how to cook a Sunday roast French style but a lot of these things are from I think TV series is that is done or series you doing anyway he's got prisoners explained why jail doesn't work get this is a series he's doing good Gordon Behind Bars and I'm not sure over soon on television or just a YouTube series but this started 3 months ago and by the looks of things it is still going on I would assume is on television as his videos are only for 34 minutes long and Goldman goes it Gordon he probably did have quite a lot to say um yeah it appears that he did do a lot of cooking with the prisoners I've got beef Wellington prison Style with Gordon behind bars and how Gordon has changed to prisoners and I would assume that was me neither by yelling at them as it is Gordon or by teaching them good cooking tips for just what I kind of hope it would be as it is on a Cooking Channel so again if you have anything to say about this subject please do feel free to tweet me with the hashtag Natasha's noise and after this next song we are going to talk about Rosanna Pansino who is at 5 million and her series called nerdy nummies so I'm next song is Gotta Get Thru This by Daniel Bedingfield I think it's safe to say that cooking on YouTube bringing people and computers together Secklow sounds for this is lazy sunday Jamie Fulton 520 Secklow sounds I have music to soothe you groove you and give you ready for your week ahead. 5 Sundays on Secklow sounds community radio 4 milton Keynes come back to Natasha's Noise Here on Secklow sounds community radio 4 milton Keynes and so next I want to focus on Rosanna Pansino and she is a YouTuber that I watch quite a lot she doesn't make meals with such as she usually makes sweet things like cakes cake pop that kind of thing and I want to focus on her series called Andy Murray's and she cleans it is a geeky cooking show and it has had over 23 million views it was last updated 3 days ago when she made Instagram Brownies and in the series she just makes things is based off of TV shows game my favourite videos of hers have to be the Minecraft onesie gets very creative with the decorations of things she's made Adventure Time thing thing thing for example she's got Adventures home Royal she's made My Little Pony cupcake lots of Super Mario things and same as Pac-Man to enter the face of making popsicles she's got some milkshake for on there an up-and-coming thing it's not something that everybody is talking about yet maybe it won't be something everybody starts talking about but I personally think that maybe it should be I think it is a good way to help some people but also she has got a cookbook just for the night in armies and it is called the nerdy nummies cookbook I believe that would make sense and yet she's just I find the videos have videos of very easy to watch them very easy to follow I have made some of her things before I believe I made um Minecraft Square type things that's marshmallows and Rice Krispies mixed together Aaron just kind of makes a sticky mess that tastes really nice I just died for a stink with one of my cousin's birthday is and was turned it green and made them into creepers from the game Minecraft she's done a lot of video like that she's got the Sims Key Lime Pie um obviously using the line as the logo from since she's got cooking Mama chocolate corner a lot of Minecraft things just have another highly watch video that she's got how to make Emoji cookies and also a grumpy Cat cake so she is very very quick with her again when it comes to spotting the not even just young people I just think it's a good way to get people cooking and the same way you do with makeup tutorials that takes practice and it just brings another dimension in to YouTube shows that people who are suffering YouTube embed just before they go to sleep then not just sat there doing nothing the people going to make like he has got Simpsons grave doughnuts like she knows how to appeal to a wider audience and I like how they use nerdy nummies on all she does like she can cater towards the GTA community but she also does obviously challenges that food rated how channel is food where is a lot of other channels are beauty related but girl from tangents and talk about food in one video all of her videos of food and DIY holiday treat the not my arms challenge but the thing I like about her not my arms challenge thirsty all described but not my arms challenge is not my arms challenge is when you are sat down somebody is sat behind you really closely behind you and you won't have to put a T-shirt over yourselves and the person that in front puts their arms behind the person sat behind them and then the person that behind Sims Arms go through the arm holes of this really big t-shirts so the person in front has no control over what we're doing it just looks like it's the other person arms and the man behind currency we're doing either that looks like the gist of it but she's done the not my arms challenge decorating a cake and often the not my arms challenge is done with daily activities that you wouldn't actually really do or get Ready With Me types of videos for example I think it could have been so we enjoy they did Ron wear one of them had to brush the other ones teeth in and do the make-up and brush the hair and it just looks quite messy in that they weren't really sure of a video to do that week where is because her whole channel is based on one thing it doesn't look like that all it looks like she knows exactly what she's doing and you can tell that you don't know exactly what was you doing with the amount of subscribers this year you can learn to use you but just kind of the point I was trying to make last week when I was talking about revision channels and videos and that kind of thing but as I said the doughnut challenge is got a pumpkin carving challenge which again is quite basic for a lot of YouTubers to do it's kind of an easy go to video but because she has a Cooking Channel she can get away with doing that kind of thing she is gone she does giveaways a lot of YouTubers do giveaways and she also has a book for announcement so that elements of her which are not cliche of a YouTuber but she's heading in the same stats as the Big Easy was like Zoella with the book stores and the giveaways that kind of thing and in his give away they just give away usually quite expensive things I know that before back to school kind of thing they often do stationary giveaways all the YouTubers so but the idea of a giveaway is fit do you have to be subscribed to a channel phone the other way which makes sense it's another word for them to and subscribers she is giving away in this particular one her recipe book Her Majesty's cookbook which again fair enough and just got reaction to my cookbook so she does promote herself while on his channel will interest yeah I like that she can fit in with the convention YouTubers in that sound with the whole book stores and the giveaways but I always feel like how she links them into what has hanel really is about where is other YouTubers make it seem like they're posting videos because they have to post videos she is posting videos because it's what she's good and because it's which she likes to do and I find out a lot with both cooking channels and art channels of art channel that I do quite like to watch is called bananas your mama I believe and that is a camel run by Jamie Joe her boyfriend her husband now sorry Tom Byrne chianti is the runner of summer cities he is very high up in the world of YouTube however neither of them have that many subscribers she is only at 13 100000 yes you that 1000 and I feel like so yes the cooking side of YouTube not many of my friends watch the cooking side of YouTube Rich again surprise me because me liking YouTube I am friends with a lot of people who also like YouTube and I was messaging a lot of them today as I was thinking about the show and I was messaging them asking them know what cooking channels they were do Youtube channels do on the YouTube channels that you cooking whether they're just making the video for the sake of just making a video or whether they're making the video because they want to I feel like you can't really tell because what they doing something that a girl out which means they're doing something with a enjoy and they don't put pressure on themselves to and you can tell when they do it you can always tell any YouTubers fitting pressure upon themselves to upload regularly but it's the same with Jamie Oliver and Gordon Ramsay take a post so many custom videos so many but they would all be useful for somebody like they're going to be so many videos on YouTube of how to boil an egg for example but if people need to know how to boil an egg then you tube is going to be a good place to go because it's fun places you can pause you can rewatch rather than breathing and having to Google definitions of words or phone you know and after that ingredient is because it's being explained to You bear and then and people who have question to the bathroom in the comment and somebody who knows the answer will have answered it so I personally feel like cooking in the YouTube community should be asked quite a lot I feel like it should be something that is spoken about more I think it's something we should be watching more I'm here at the moment that's cool and you get taught food tech up until you in only in some schools not all schools teaching food technology not all schools give you cooking lesson little schools offer that my school does whether they watched over and they all said I'm sorry I do not watch the cooking side of YouTube and that's good shopping because for two years and then you have to decide whether or not you would like to take that as a GCSE option then if you don't want to take it as a GCSE you don't do it anymore I say it's it is it's a life skill it's something that everybody should be able to do which is why I feel like having cooking on YouTube is so important because you Tuesday and access the people of all ages now people from even the ages of 3 or 4 I mean hopefully with parental guidance there are really young children that have access to the Internet but also the older generation are getting more into that side of things as well the other ancient are getting into welcome back to Natasha's know if you want Secklow sounds community radio from milton Keynes and we are now joined with  \"you first or Antalya how you met me last week I had a stadium Bradford to but he's a little bit shy I think so I'm just going to leave in 20 guys I've been talking about cooking on YouTube what your thoughts are like tipsybartender a lot alright thanks for that  \"the bartender is is he handsome woman and some woman he's always got this  \"triangular Lodge Triangular elements white element that have just described I do and I know that my sister's do and they obviously do that for any influence of me we have Holly and her tipsy bartender so I feel like that is Taken that one colleague that's ENT where is thing hello there I don't want to be anything when you call her baby because you're saying it's a TNT sorry that is the end of the passive noise feel free to continue listening to T&T after this show pictures to praise me because I personally find it easier to learn how to cook a recipe for example the cake I'll find it much easier to cook that cake following somebody junior ice cream rather than yeah that's just the way I would find it easier I would find it a lot easier to find a video to show me how to do it rather than reading her a text book which again comes back to last week's video where people learn things differently and I feel like cooking is no different to that a lot of mainstream YouTubers have taken cooking as a segment of the show is there a channel sorry um a good example of that is Tanya Burr she has a lots of subscribers I will just checked her subscription number now and he does allsorts videos she is mainly beauty related as she used to work for Laura Mercier I believe and um she has a lot of modelling work a lot of makeup artistry work that kind of thing and yes she's recently got into baking and she bought out a book last year and it's been announced that she is now going up cookbook she has 3.4 million subscribers currently bringing Communities Together Secklow sounds Ricky and Nate and show on Secklow sounds real life with some features the Ricky Nathan show Wednesdays at 10 a.m. on Secklow sounds community radio 4 milton Keynes welcome back to the sachas Noisy on Secklow sounds community radio 4 milton Keynes and she get the majority of videos consist of the standard beauty blogger videos she has holes and get ready for me years and some blogs she has a vlogging Channel 4 that I think I may have logged appear to be on her main channel um and yeah uh-huh Las cooking video with just 2 months ago actually I believe and she also inserts blog baking and her blog so she does do a lot baking on a channel but she hasn't does a k hole video Stewart all of the time the last baking video was baking a Christmas cake where she made a cake and biscuits go around the cake and yet so I thought it was quite interesting how she is bringing out a cookbook dedicated to this all because of you and yellow to find that quite interesting as cooking isn't really Hanningfield and main field is invited make-up and that kind of thing so I found that quite interesting another person who is taking cooking outside of YouTube who is Big on YouTube is of course Zoe Sugg also known as the other she often posts blog on her own plugs and I believe around Christmas time she posted a sugar cookie recipe and she also does baking and things on a channel the sacconi Jolie is another example I know it will go through December maybe it maybe in a month prior to that actually Anna saccone Joly and the wife in that family she did a baking video everyday on a channel with her children Emilia and Eduardo and they made different types of cupcakes everyday for that Mum and so that was rewind by Craig David and so next we are going to be talking about some of the most common Youtube channels around cooking so I have a few names here and we have Gordon Ramsay you surprise me with only 1 million subscribers which seems like a lot but in comparison to Rosanna Pansino who is not famous celebrity in fact she is just a YouTuber and she is there with 5 million subscribers that did surprise me milton November actually I'm not entirely sure but yes use baking a lot in fact she does she uses quite a lot and he know what she does a what I ate Wednesday and talks a lot about what she he shows the viewers which he and she Focuses quite largely on making sure children have a balanced diet I think she has one no maybe three meals with meat a week one vegan meal another vegetarian meal and they have a pizza on a Friday and then whatever else I believe so yeah she is quite heavily based around balanced diets and food that kind of thing a lot of YouTubers now they are branching out into this whole cooking thing another example is cherry Wallis she has started it series could cherries kitchen Daniel J Layton he doesn't look a thing now I think he is one of his best videos I personally think is when he is making a pie and apple pie with Hazel Hayes and so yeah in addition to that we have Jamie Oliver who has beaten Gordon Ramsay with 2 million Heston is nowhere near the million Mark and basically somebody tweeted them a picture of a pie with a turkey that they had me a pie and made a pastry Turkey to go on top of the pie for Thanksgiving Daniel and Hazel then American buy you a visit visa American viewers Daniels English Hazel's Irish so yeah David seen this photo of this pie and they've tried to recreate the pie and the pie looks absolutely horrendous they spent ages trying to work out what the picture on the front was eventually work that it was a turkey and a good look at the picture upside down and yeah it was quite Kate also but also very very funny but Davin realised at the end of the video that this is the second year that this girl have sent them a picture of the spine is the second year that they done it so it's kind of a, running joking out about the spy and Thanksgiving and so yeah I like the baking videos I like that main channel big bloggers he reach large audiences can do baking video I'm laughing I'm going to talk about offices next song is these big chefs like Gordon Ramsay and Jamie Oliver having Youtube channels as well I'm going to be speaking about that next after I found by Amber run and there is another channel which I found quite strange called cooking with dog and that channel has got 1 million subscribers on cooking with dog it is just a woman hookah bringing people and Communities Together Secklow sounds 14th Battalion 7th every Friday on Secklow sounds alternative rock bands national will be doing a question answer 7 community radio  \"welcome back to Natasha snowshill and Secklow sounds community radio 4 milton Keynes and so next I'm going to talk about Jamie Oliver and Gordon Ramsay's Youtube channels and how useful they may be for example in comparison to the other YouTubers a lot of fun just do them for a laugh a lot of the videos I may be like spoofs where they say they know videos not going to be good then I'm trying to teach you to be the next Sheff where is Jamie Oliver and Gordon Ramsay I feel like they're actually gonna show you how to cook real food they're not going to sit there make a 20 minute video on how to make a cupcake because those breastfeeds her on Google and quite frankly a cupcake isn't too difficult to me looking at Jamie Oliver's YouTube channel he upload diary regularly in the last 7 videos so eapc upload near enough every single day his last video was in fact 22 hours ago is video on too long either Who's last video is Super Bowl winners at three way and sidekick in the kitchen is a dog three ways to make them two ways to eat them I don't know it is a mystery but yeah but that's fucked videos could he does wide range of things as you'd expect from Jamie Oliver with his number of series on TV and also his different um something I have noticed in regard to Jamie Oliver is he at one point last year became quiet Pally quite friendly with a lot of the big YouTubers for example Louise sprinkle of Glitter Joe Sugg is a game quite friendly with them my thing they went to his restaurant for dinner and then they went to bounce afterwards I believe there's one example and they all ends up going to the same parties and things and he obviously has a YouTube channel going himself and I know that he invited a lot of the YouTubers to his set to cook and I think that one on both of the channel but that was maybe not even last year I read more than that are good for you is going out um so yeah another channel that also did quite surprising is the Great British Bake Off they do not have as many subscribers as I expected he does enough to the oatcake he's got a black forest frozen cheesecake here but then he's also go oh he just emails he's got spaghetti carbonara and Thai lemongrass and chilli shrimp food busker that sounds very fancy he's got different curry but this is the kind of thing I was looking for that I've just found he does things called one minute tips this is what I was looking for here yes obviously he is going to want his videos to appeal to an audience but also to help and audiences got here how to finely slice parrot looks like that's a one minute video how to replace an egg in baking butter for 1 minute video how to roast chestnuts in an oven one minute and they are not as active as I expected their last video was posted 1 year ago and there Fail Safe staffing he just does as well as meals he does the or little thing you've got pigs in blankets with cranberry sauce and also another one minute tips which is how you make bread sauce show and how to safely freeze cooked meat so you don't do a lot of useful things on his channel as well as obviously fancy things I feel like you find a lot of these recipes in his books so it is another way to promote what he's already got I guess you could say this kind of Ryan's me and maybe I'll give him for the future of Alfie deyes pointless books were he's got an app to go with the book and if you hold do you like iPhone or camera phone device over a logo on the book it shows you it comes up with the video it just wrote Alfie doing that specific thing for example head cake mugs in there and mug cakes 40 he had mug cakes and he was just showing his audience how to make them through a video as well as it being in the book and I feel like maybe that something he could integrate to his channel potentially links of books more so that the more accessible for both YouTube answer the books and so he has got two million subscribers as I said and I did not expecting to be uploading that much but as he does that does not surprise me as much as I expected it to however Gordon Ramsay's last video was uploaded four days ago " .

consisting ingredients and trustworthy manufacturers pet food sometimes get a bad name but that's like demonizing restaurant Seaburn quality balance exactly what they are good quality prepared diet takes the complexity and risk out of providing healthy nutrition to your pets and I highly recommend home prepared diet so little more complex I think we can all agree that is a diet to be as balanced as a commercial one that made at home from Fresh ingredients well at the ideal but the weirdest thing a diet for an animal is not easy we often adjusted by craving foods that we lacking and it's Fragments of children are provided with a birthday party style spread their initially went straight into the ice cream and jelly but after a few hours started self selecting of a balanced diet from the healthier food available now this is how animals would normally balance there in Take That member they can't browse from an optimal but they really eat what we give them is really important with rabbits and birds and also the sea animals because they can select just the good bits and not balance there research is vital for home prepared diet if you have the time and ability and crack on your petrol love them to be prepared for a big one your argument is between cooked and raw ingredients that this is a tricky one as although there is anecdotal evidence on each side very few scientific studies have been done the main arguments for or is that that's what animals have evolved to eat which is true but then says we are not even the purest clean eating bloggers advocating eating raw out of a tour in the absence of malice pet foods make meat protein more easily digestible and a course that kills bacteria and parasites this is why we do it yourself one strong arguments for diets is the claim that raw bones good for animals teeth now it's starting to make sense all again no refunds being done to back this up that doesn't make it wrong just unproven some afraid I can't really good

as complex but totally different to those found in a Moroccan tagine but it's got lots of love Mummy what type of cherries have the nickname and that is about as far as my cherry knowledge goes there seen machine ok now I had no idea the saliva of which birds you is used in making beer actually I think I do know this is certainly I talked about it a lot with the Bird's Nest Stadium in when the Olympics Road we love experimenting when we travel we really follow the tourist trail while we're away but we will see and I haven't taken a bus tours around Tuscany not something we normally do and when it was launched I'm the guide suggested where we should eat a little restaurant right on the main Square no no no that we headed up a laneway from the terrace and sounds a little cafe filled with locals to this date I have never eaten a bit of soup then the River Otter I head there and it was the same as yet but never had it myself is it like something like that Germany angels on horseback posters raptor no that is really familiar generally get this thing I think of being wrapped in his bacon butty so that they not angels in blankets pigs on horseback how to equip a single size

don't know what's my name why we love our food there was a time when another person's behaviour towards food actually sticking or a not quite a pint if you're English actually soaps a little bit that we want to talk about it is of course healthy food masquerade naughty food without yes it's going back to what we were talking about with a list of super healthy foods it's just the ones at the end of the list which I thought was quite interesting because on the face that you wouldn't think of them if they do they probably in excess are not so good for you I do have a lot of good and the first one of these is the derries we have a lot of people of assume you have an intolerance to dairy and there are certain series about the people said that you know when we're not used to eating dairy as as a subspecies because it's something with only come to in the last few thousand years and that which is not natural first to have It Your Way don't forget to do tolerate them they are a healthy source of a lot of important full fat dairy seems to be the better though it again the 1800 see if you have too much of it it can be an issue but people who eat the most full fat dairy have a lower risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes this is really not let you know if the dairy comes from grass fed cows than that could be even better and it's higher in bioactive fatty like CLA which I'm not sure what CLA is maybe you can look it up so another one on that list is cheese as this would be very pleased to hear about the same nutrients as an intern we're on a cruise and we looking founded by the archetype ugly American he was all sample good and he was having lunch in the bath and they are marketed as a die we're not very scientific in the last 10 k team after a personal trainer Andover ok it

systematically travelling from each plate under his place and consumer it in a non stop Fernando wasn't know it was me it was that if n hustle yes wrong with John Barrowman they are an unhealthy substance known as I could not believe the lack of enforcement he seemed to have with his food at no point did he stop to savour what he was leaving he had a portion of everything that was on offer in the room so is he he just confused all the flavours it was like someone had taken the colours of the rainbow and instead of appreciating each one for one of these mixable map to make a muddy brown colour and let me know my changes experience with food to be just married jumble with it no flavour no picture without highlight the expiry ok but it's not that great OK God. I know and the Huntsman the dairy site is one the body would think of more is it healthy food yes I've made from milk that's fermented by adding live bacteria cultures to it and has many of the same health effects of milk except with added benefits of friendly probiotic bacteria and that is particularly comes things that yeah Colt or probiotics it's about that it is about the friendly back here they're the ones that help digestion it's funny you should say that the probiotic yoghurt shops and feeling ill I love you anyway make sensory sounds like an antibiotic probiotic balance is out and it's it is because the thing with antibiotics that they don't differentiate between a good bacteria and bad bacteria lose just kill everything so bye then adding that probiotic in your replenishing

Cooley was that it came in it wouldn't make a meal for me I want to see your face at the end of them Sam is a lot so yeah moving on from that is with this about that not all fats are bad for you is true that there are fats and oils as well that are actually good send out destiny is coconut oil isn't is a really nice of absolutely everything yeah it's loaded with powerful fatty acids called medium chain triglycerides say getting technically I may have benefits for those with Alzheimers disease and has been shown to help you lose belly fat so might be working let us know if you and experience with absolutely extra virgin olive oil which is known as it's about me the healthiest fat on earth it contains heart healthy monounsaturated fats say again it's as mono unsaturated fats

very very lovely and it's going to be very very funny so it does it does a festival also um this is a bit we're going to the festival I've been after shout out an excluded daxtonbury festival you had with no this is the first first festival in the I think this ever happened to Michaela hasn't heard of so let's just all get around the most brilliant if I've heard if I have not heard of it must be excellent the last show their favourite actress hot sauce Pony which I have absolutely no idea I mean is that like tequila Mockingbird um I think that's playing words to think I kill To Kill a

not real pigeon shooting anyway we'll going to shut up and enjoy some more music for that week and I haven't heard the song a while so I have a lesson but funny one that's never been to a festival in Henley this may explain the Vibes and explain what goes on at festivals anything just explain what happens at festivals go for it Michaela see what happens at festivals is everyone has a really good time and that is because you're surrounded by people who you love and you care about and obviously fear of surround yourself with people that you like and because of that your rules it's all is going to be nice weather and because it's nice weather always makes people happier around always smiling I was having a good time and get very muddy at very dirty but that's all part of the best experience of my opinion vibration pay for a shower when you can be that it in feels it is also music which I obviously loves to be the main attraction oh yeah I love I love everything to do festivals so that even the clothing festival clothing is crazy is there anyone ever see Instagram festival clothes thank you thank you I just got of a compliment but it was like you just look like someone you get

Cameras as well and we have them here in the studio my knee hurts stills work cuz that's what it was we we drifted up so that we've got the originals is it normal a big head that goes over your head on my think about me differently to a few years later than that when you're looking down a big viewer but that sort of thing she holds a little thing up that flashes and then we've got 16 millimetre cine cameras is what we standardise 1931 totally until some of the people out there will them thanks here with some colour of loss and Kieran from vintage news and Sadie's the one in the dress size from vintage news which app and it's the UK's foremost vintage new screws showing you what's going on on the Vintage scene from clubs and festivals to shops and music so can you just explain to a listeners what is vintage but they won't they are all broken so we haven't actually destroyed any anyone that was working as we going out online so having film at any point of the process in which film online family traveller you say rather than it be thrown away in a broken thrown away never used again at least they are in booking you don't know they are being looked at and you can talk about them rather than just been consigned to the landfill yes or no right from the outset it was obvious to us that if you were going to have a camera phone if it was a nice old looking camera you wouldn't mind nearly as much yeah so I suppose the one thing we've always maintained web cameras live in the way who was the first week going out of someone's mobile phone I just don't know what to do with people joining in singing this if you want to say hello but something tongue-tied for cameras I had to help you but I was just must messing with the 4th Harry and Edna. Co.uk this is why I tell you what I was going out with somebody we go to the Vintage events that could be 74 hours 10 to look for something you do know when you listen we do yes phone Mum upset but that the count he listens to the rescue summer swimming at deyes search vintage news is something that you do to do full time or is it as well as lots of luggage well I understand a couple of days in the office and sting and button yeah I've got yes way yes way we have to have real joy well I do anyway so I know just what you mean I know just what you mean yeah freelance to work teach me know and obviously definitely the main main front Burton is he trying to make up for that day today Lotus and we built to our first camera and tripod and say ok this Christian try and go and crash a vintage fair return doesn't with vintage news I was going to stand in front of the camera now and it's taken quite realise that maybe having a girl was like something be there for the referee in Bingley the Diplomat in the middle find postgres update you when you go to events you both of them look the part as well sounds 24 sailing what we're going to the specific error and vintage Style but if we going to the speakeasy will go but my Twenties you going to the Mods mod you have quite an extensive wardrobe what are some of the most fun events that you've gone stop think the chat events always until spring to mind both the chap Olympiad in just because a lot of people if I can only make one event in the episode they don't know it's one of those duties explain to Alison's what the chappie because I might not quite understand that is a magazine that Club Penguin what's the real name for terrible just saw that it was all about the pre and appreciation of tweed and pipes and the earth in the gentleman and they started organise event space with people that read that what we probably got stuffing common we'd like to meet up I just think that we think will be the Olympiad McQ is very silly and us sporting events so we've described it as a drunken sports day what everyone is very well dressed didn't you get knocked off you got you got some really interesting we just get on with your life sleep this year there was a little bit sorry actually doing the sea of course that is because I mean this year we must get CD on a bicycle with a camera on the bicycle with her cycling around London and ice good for your other cities now we run ambient cycling along the Houses of Parliament going to look sounds Big Ben and then driving and our cameraman Lesbos with standing out the top because it's fun because you have you must have some real characters dressed up in there to eat with a brace do they still smoking pipes for my cycling sometimes an hour  \"what is Harry and what a redness and what a wonderful day today I don't know where to look I no go over here do I look over there what do I look about everywhere because I'm so tempted to go to wrap them but is not allowed from another radio station date they have to stop Trafalgar Square and all of the chaps has all of the Anther tweed run cyclist through to the one time that you get right of way 500 cyclists hey that's the quite a lot of them and they all keep it from various be quite dangerous how many people are on Earth are not generally who is Italy tea they consume at the break time or is it more like a gin and tonic 18 old world is completely and utterly I'm almost mandatory to have a hip flask yeah um so of course an awful lot of one thing that interests me is why wait wait your background to Reno your backgrounds in film TV presentation is it something I said I never had the camera when did use with Step Over the threshold with me into filming and photography Mr hobby no Italy got to do something event were driven by the interesting vintage as a whole that that is that you then went off into doing vintage musical I know you're talking about wanting to find out what was going on in the scene well yeah I suppose I did have a few second Harry and I yeah um you know I'm in some people like there something if you dry clothes on that can be good fun are you like how you just don't do camping anymore you just leave this is so good it's been awhile but not lead you into two then picking up a car what do the film me and and leisure cameraman new stations from Japan yeah yeah but nothing to the covering the Vintage aspect of them to me is coming over to cover all the events cuz I'm a female we can't you need in this country have you heard of any events abroad where you kind of fancy going off in America but you share a bit of it through camera work not just photography but will live camera work as well gifts yeah that's really supposed to do 20s and 30s is kind of like that possibly with gatsby's release that's going to go yeah but visible to everyone who is really decided that the nature of the end more like modern clothes the he had those way before Johnny Depp started wearing them wearing his glasses so they say I look like my dad from 50 Manchester don't get it for ages fashion goes in wa knowledgeable knowledgeable about it yeah they're claiming it is Vin do you think there's still quite a future in the Vintage scene when do you still have lots of work coming in is it still an expanding seating because we always thought Harry know that it has got to come to the ceiling at some point but we still seem to be growing and growing but what worry dolls was that I don't mind being 60 years out of fashion but I don't want to be oh so last year um what I mean it's difficult when you start getting into this is there is it expanding or are you just a scar but I suppose this directly people were always types of nostalgia when when the economic Outlook is bleak so I guess and until everyone starts thinking about buying the next sports car we've got a good chance how do you think is Seville so wrapped it up in a um there was a hole what I'm saying in an early fifties about holidaying at home and Britain being grey and stay at home. For the advent of the package holiday but I do think people also tuned into that wrapped up in this nostalgia bring me something to eat now so you don't have to deal with the coming and going trends Odysseus she found that but it's still a growing scene I mean cuz I'm just thinking now I've spoke earlier about what Katie did she is she runs out a lingerie Range and thats getting more and more popular but it's not just within the Vintage scene is this also within the events of normal people going into all different areas of the music do you have to keep a breast of that by then going right let's go and Phil Leeds let's go and find out what they are but something we do spend quite a bit of time of course Crawley and sometimes you will have to go and film something the of viewers want to see it or irrelevant of Hell lovely milton you are just talking about the length of time in when they were YouTube clips don't really realise the amount of time it must take you to put these together well if examples um so we had I think 600 n600 order photos to go through that will have to be sorted out footage have to be all the hours review can of taking off from there it's really am just trying to set the scene YouTube O2 events shops clubs and see what's going on in the Vintage scene and then you film it recorded and then to put it onto an Internet station and usable penalty together than Music sounds from and we will try if you include the photographs in in the work of editing you can how long does the actual event last could not an all day event at Olympia well Disley twinwoods on the horizon um so and then we know it will be too yes we have I have around YouTube YouTube channel um and then we effectively did you what's going on between now and then though it is pretty open we try not to um just cause you never know what call you going to get some people contact to use to invite you to events to come and film them I think the best way it's fully email us at news desk at vintage news. TV and that's also the place that you know that if you wish to advertise on a website um because we great place to advertise but we've been getting some of roughly 30 35000 hits a month sounds like we're doing yes darling so um yeah me if you if you've got an event that you want to be filmed then there yet by all means getting obviously even if it's not something that's super duper news were the four of us then we do appreciate the help with the costs of yes it especially if it's quite far away there's a role for somebody who interviews to look at events that you currently done is through your website to link into the YouTube clips which soda so we can link all of the things that www.vintage.tv brilliant so going to have a look and look at the how many photographs sounds over 4000 that's from the 8083 videos won't be done today people so yeah just search for the Vintage news all one word on either Instagram Twitter or Facebook thank you so much for coming because you've traveled all the way up from Brighton thank you for coming and join us so is that time just quickly where was it was it vintage news docs whenever www.vintage.tv Iceland I'm a sweet you want to go there and then I put a safety detail and it's a toodle pip from me well I'm trying to interview Harry last week and he was trying to avoid being York festival of vintage on the 23rd and 24th of April sportive Harry and Edna on the wireless I suppose further from my perspective when I started to get into this service adjusting like this was the same but I managed to grill you pin you down and grill you a good way of getting across to people the raft of things that go on in the Vintage think they really isn't it's not just that you say it's not just dancing um it's not just Events there's lots of other little bits that go on as well yes and we don't just stick to one will this think of the television actually take off 1880s 90s and I was done stuff up to the 60s but mainly it's for same.

Secklow sounds Friday  \"clicking noise radio and today we are going to be talking about cooking channels on YouTube and with the helpful who makes them the kind of number of subscribers they have and that kind of thing so please feel free to get involved using the hashtag with her  \"start the show we have next week  \"my mental friend Georgia and Mia so this is more commonly known as the theme song for Insidious so here we go next loo  \"EastEnders live show you subscription rate is not that high with only 16 thousand subscribers and that did surprise me given the fact that this sport relief celebrity sport relief episode of any that was on Wednesday this week so I would have expected there to maybe be some promotion on the YouTube channel potentially hippies to upload very regularly as well once a week it seems it looks quite a lot like he's there was 1 million but a lot of obviously kicking his last video of how to cook a Sunday roast French style but a lot of these things are from I think TV series is that is done or series you doing anyway he's got prisoners explained why jail doesn't work get this is a series he's doing good Gordon Behind Bars and I'm not sure over soon on television or just a YouTube series but this started 3 months ago and by the looks of things it is still going on I would assume is on television as his videos are only for 34 minutes long and Goldman goes it Gordon he probably did have quite a lot to say um yeah it appears that he did do a lot of cooking with the prisoners I've got beef Wellington prison Style with Gordon behind bars and how Gordon has changed to prisoners and I would assume that was me neither by yelling at them as it is Gordon or by teaching them good cooking tips for just what I kind of hope it would be as it is on a Cooking Channel so again if you have anything to say about this subject please do feel free to tweet me with the hashtag Natasha's noise and after this next song we are going to talk about Rosanna Pansino who is at 5 million and her series called nerdy nummies so I'm next song is Gotta Get Thru This by Daniel Bedingfield I think it's safe to say that cooking on YouTube bringing people and computers together Secklow sounds for this is lazy sunday Jamie Fulton 520 Secklow sounds I have music to soothe you groove you and give you ready for your week ahead. 5 Sundays on Secklow sounds community radio 4 milton Keynes come back to Natasha's Noise Here on Secklow sounds community radio 4 milton Keynes and so next I want to focus on Rosanna Pansino and she is a YouTuber that I watch quite a lot she doesn't make meals with such as she usually makes sweet things like cakes cake pop that kind of thing and I want to focus on her series called Andy Murray's and she cleans it is a geeky cooking show and it has had over 23 million views it was last updated 3 days ago when she made Instagram Brownies and in the series she just makes things is based off of TV shows game my favourite videos of hers have to be the Minecraft onesie gets very creative with the decorations of things she's made Adventure Time thing thing thing for example she's got Adventures home Royal she's made My Little Pony cupcake lots of Super Mario things and same as Pac-Man to enter the face of making popsicles she's got some milkshake for on there an up-and-coming thing it's not something that everybody is talking about yet maybe it won't be something everybody starts talking about but I personally think that maybe it should be I think it is a good way to help some people but also she has got a cookbook just for the night in armies and it is called the nerdy nummies cookbook I believe that would make sense and yet she's just I find the videos have videos of very easy to watch them very easy to follow I have made some of her things before I believe I made um Minecraft Square type things that's marshmallows and Rice Krispies mixed together Aaron just kind of makes a sticky mess that tastes really nice I just died for a stink with one of my cousin's birthday is and was turned it green and made them into creepers from the game Minecraft she's done a lot of video like that she's got the Sims Key Lime Pie um obviously using the line as the logo from since she's got cooking Mama chocolate corner a lot of Minecraft things just have another highly watch video that she's got how to make Emoji cookies and also a grumpy Cat cake so she is very very quick with her again when it comes to spotting the not even just young people I just think it's a good way to get people cooking and the same way you do with makeup tutorials that takes practice and it just brings another dimension in to YouTube shows that people who are suffering YouTube embed just before they go to sleep then not just sat there doing nothing the people going to make like he has got Simpsons grave doughnuts like she knows how to appeal to a wider audience and I like how they use nerdy nummies on all she does like she can cater towards the GTA community but she also does obviously challenges that food rated how channel is food where is a lot of other channels are beauty related but girl from tangents and talk about food in one video all of her videos of food and DIY holiday treat the not my arms challenge but the thing I like about her not my arms challenge thirsty all described but not my arms challenge is not my arms challenge is when you are sat down somebody is sat behind you really closely behind you and you won't have to put a T-shirt over yourselves and the person that in front puts their arms behind the person sat behind them and then the person that behind Sims Arms go through the arm holes of this really big t-shirts so the person in front has no control over what we're doing it just looks like it's the other person arms and the man behind currency we're doing either that looks like the gist of it but she's done the not my arms challenge decorating a cake and often the not my arms challenge is done with daily activities that you wouldn't actually really do or get Ready With Me types of videos for example I think it could have been so we enjoy they did Ron wear one of them had to brush the other ones teeth in and do the make-up and brush the hair and it just looks quite messy in that they weren't really sure of a video to do that week where is because her whole channel is based on one thing it doesn't look like that all it looks like she knows exactly what she's doing and you can tell that you don't know exactly what was you doing with the amount of subscribers this year you can learn to use you but just kind of the point I was trying to make last week when I was talking about revision channels and videos and that kind of thing but as I said the doughnut challenge is got a pumpkin carving challenge which again is quite basic for a lot of YouTubers to do it's kind of an easy go to video but because she has a Cooking Channel she can get away with doing that kind of thing she is gone she does giveaways a lot of YouTubers do giveaways and she also has a book for announcement so that elements of her which are not cliche of a YouTuber but she's heading in the same stats as the Big Easy was like Zoella with the book stores and the giveaways that kind of thing and in his give away they just give away usually quite expensive things I know that before back to school kind of thing they often do stationary giveaways all the YouTubers so but the idea of a giveaway is fit do you have to be subscribed to a channel phone the other way which makes sense it's another word for them to and subscribers she is giving away in this particular one her recipe book Her Majesty's cookbook which again fair enough and just got reaction to my cookbook so she does promote herself while on his channel will interest yeah I like that she can fit in with the convention YouTubers in that sound with the whole book stores and the giveaways but I always feel like how she links them into what has hanel really is about where is other YouTubers make it seem like they're posting videos because they have to post videos she is posting videos because it's what she's good and because it's which she likes to do and I find out a lot with both cooking channels and art channels of art channel that I do quite like to watch is called bananas your mama I believe and that is a camel run by Jamie Joe her boyfriend her husband now sorry Tom Byrne chianti is the runner of summer cities he is very high up in the world of YouTube however neither of them have that many subscribers she is only at 13 100000 yes you that 1000 and I feel like so yes the cooking side of YouTube not many of my friends watch the cooking side of YouTube Rich again surprise me because me liking YouTube I am friends with a lot of people who also like YouTube and I was messaging a lot of them today as I was thinking about the show and I was messaging them asking them know what cooking channels they were do Youtube channels do on the YouTube channels that you cooking whether they're just making the video for the sake of just making a video or whether they're making the video because they want to I feel like you can't really tell because what they doing something that a girl out which means they're doing something with a enjoy and they don't put pressure on themselves to and you can tell when they do it you can always tell any YouTubers fitting pressure upon themselves to upload regularly but it's the same with Jamie Oliver and Gordon Ramsay take a post so many custom videos so many but they would all be useful for somebody like they're going to be so many videos on YouTube of how to boil an egg for example but if people need to know how to boil an egg then you tube is going to be a good place to go because it's fun places you can pause you can rewatch rather than breathing and having to Google definitions of words or phone you know and after that ingredient is because it's being explained to You bear and then and people who have question to the bathroom in the comment and somebody who knows the answer will have answered it so I personally feel like cooking in the YouTube community should be asked quite a lot I feel like it should be something that is spoken about more I think it's something we should be watching more I'm here at the moment that's cool and you get taught food tech up until you in only in some schools not all schools teaching food technology not all schools give you cooking lesson little schools offer that my school does whether they watched over and they all said I'm sorry I do not watch the cooking side of YouTube and that's good shopping because for two years and then you have to decide whether or not you would like to take that as a GCSE option then if you don't want to take it as a GCSE you don't do it anymore I say it's it is it's a life skill it's something that everybody should be able to do which is why I feel like having cooking on YouTube is so important because you Tuesday and access the people of all ages now people from even the ages of 3 or 4 I mean hopefully with parental guidance there are really young children that have access to the Internet but also the older generation are getting more into that side of things as well the other ancient are getting into welcome back to Natasha's know if you want Secklow sounds community radio from milton Keynes and we are now joined with  \"you first or Antalya how you met me last week I had a stadium Bradford to but he's a little bit shy I think so I'm just going to leave in 20 guys I've been talking about cooking on YouTube what your thoughts are like tipsybartender a lot alright thanks for that  \"the bartender is is he handsome woman and some woman he's always got this  \"triangular Lodge Triangular elements white element that have just described I do and I know that my sister's do and they obviously do that for any influence of me we have Holly and her tipsy bartender so I feel like that is Taken that one colleague that's ENT where is thing hello there I don't want to be anything when you call her baby because you're saying it's a TNT sorry that is the end of the passive noise feel free to continue listening to T&T after this show pictures to praise me because I personally find it easier to learn how to cook a recipe for example the cake I'll find it much easier to cook that cake following somebody junior ice cream rather than yeah that's just the way I would find it easier I would find it a lot easier to find a video to show me how to do it rather than reading her a text book which again comes back to last week's video where people learn things differently and I feel like cooking is no different to that a lot of mainstream YouTubers have taken cooking as a segment of the show is there a channel sorry um a good example of that is Tanya Burr she has a lots of subscribers I will just checked her subscription number now and he does allsorts videos she is mainly beauty related as she used to work for Laura Mercier I believe and um she has a lot of modelling work a lot of makeup artistry work that kind of thing and yes she's recently got into baking and she bought out a book last year and it's been announced that she is now going up cookbook she has 3.4 million subscribers currently bringing Communities Together Secklow sounds Ricky and Nate and show on Secklow sounds real life with some features the Ricky Nathan show Wednesdays at 10 a.m. on Secklow sounds community radio 4 milton Keynes welcome back to the sachas Noisy on Secklow sounds community radio 4 milton Keynes and she get the majority of videos consist of the standard beauty blogger videos she has holes and get ready for me years and some blogs she has a vlogging Channel 4 that I think I may have logged appear to be on her main channel um and yeah uh-huh Las cooking video with just 2 months ago actually I believe and she also inserts blog baking and her blog so she does do a lot baking on a channel but she hasn't does a k hole video Stewart all of the time the last baking video was baking a Christmas cake where she made a cake and biscuits go around the cake and yet so I thought it was quite interesting how she is bringing out a cookbook dedicated to this all because of you and yellow to find that quite interesting as cooking isn't really Hanningfield and main field is invited make-up and that kind of thing so I found that quite interesting another person who is taking cooking outside of YouTube who is Big on YouTube is of course Zoe Sugg also known as the other she often posts blog on her own plugs and I believe around Christmas time she posted a sugar cookie recipe and she also does baking and things on a channel the sacconi Jolie is another example I know it will go through December maybe it maybe in a month prior to that actually Anna saccone Joly and the wife in that family she did a baking video everyday on a channel with her children Emilia and Eduardo and they made different types of cupcakes everyday for that Mum and so that was rewind by Craig David and so next we are going to be talking about some of the most common Youtube channels around cooking so I have a few names here and we have Gordon Ramsay you surprise me with only 1 million subscribers which seems like a lot but in comparison to Rosanna Pansino who is not famous celebrity in fact she is just a YouTuber and she is there with 5 million subscribers that did surprise me milton November actually I'm not entirely sure but yes use baking a lot in fact she does she uses quite a lot and he know what she does a what I ate Wednesday and talks a lot about what she he shows the viewers which he and she Focuses quite largely on making sure children have a balanced diet I think she has one no maybe three meals with meat a week one vegan meal another vegetarian meal and they have a pizza on a Friday and then whatever else I believe so yeah she is quite heavily based around balanced diets and food that kind of thing a lot of YouTubers now they are branching out into this whole cooking thing another example is cherry Wallis she has started it series could cherries kitchen Daniel J Layton he doesn't look a thing now I think he is one of his best videos I personally think is when he is making a pie and apple pie with Hazel Hayes and so yeah in addition to that we have Jamie Oliver who has beaten Gordon Ramsay with 2 million Heston is nowhere near the million Mark and basically somebody tweeted them a picture of a pie with a turkey that they had me a pie and made a pastry Turkey to go on top of the pie for Thanksgiving Daniel and Hazel then American buy you a visit visa American viewers Daniels English Hazel's Irish so yeah David seen this photo of this pie and they've tried to recreate the pie and the pie looks absolutely horrendous they spent ages trying to work out what the picture on the front was eventually work that it was a turkey and a good look at the picture upside down and yeah it was quite Kate also but also very very funny but Davin realised at the end of the video that this is the second year that this girl have sent them a picture of the spine is the second year that they done it so it's kind of a, running joking out about the spy and Thanksgiving and so yeah I like the baking videos I like that main channel big bloggers he reach large audiences can do baking video I'm laughing I'm going to talk about offices next song is these big chefs like Gordon Ramsay and Jamie Oliver having Youtube channels as well I'm going to be speaking about that next after I found by Amber run and there is another channel which I found quite strange called cooking with dog and that channel has got 1 million subscribers on cooking with dog it is just a woman hookah bringing people and Communities Together Secklow sounds 14th Battalion 7th every Friday on Secklow sounds alternative rock bands national will be doing a question answer 7 community radio  \"welcome back to Natasha snowshill and Secklow sounds community radio 4 milton Keynes and so next I'm going to talk about Jamie Oliver and Gordon Ramsay's Youtube channels and how useful they may be for example in comparison to the other YouTubers a lot of fun just do them for a laugh a lot of the videos I may be like spoofs where they say they know videos not going to be good then I'm trying to teach you to be the next Sheff where is Jamie Oliver and Gordon Ramsay I feel like they're actually gonna show you how to cook real food they're not going to sit there make a 20 minute video on how to make a cupcake because those breastfeeds her on Google and quite frankly a cupcake isn't too difficult to me looking at Jamie Oliver's YouTube channel he upload diary regularly in the last 7 videos so eapc upload near enough every single day his last video was in fact 22 hours ago is video on too long either Who's last video is Super Bowl winners at three way and sidekick in the kitchen is a dog three ways to make them two ways to eat them I don't know it is a mystery but yeah but that's fucked videos could he does wide range of things as you'd expect from Jamie Oliver with his number of series on TV and also his different um something I have noticed in regard to Jamie Oliver is he at one point last year became quiet Pally quite friendly with a lot of the big YouTubers for example Louise sprinkle of Glitter Joe Sugg is a game quite friendly with them my thing they went to his restaurant for dinner and then they went to bounce afterwards I believe there's one example and they all ends up going to the same parties and things and he obviously has a YouTube channel going himself and I know that he invited a lot of the YouTubers to his set to cook and I think that one on both of the channel but that was maybe not even last year I read more than that are good for you is going out um so yeah another channel that also did quite surprising is the Great British Bake Off they do not have as many subscribers as I expected he does enough to the oatcake he's got a black forest frozen cheesecake here but then he's also go oh he just emails he's got spaghetti carbonara and Thai lemongrass and chilli shrimp food busker that sounds very fancy he's got different curry but this is the kind of thing I was looking for that I've just found he does things called one minute tips this is what I was looking for here yes obviously he is going to want his videos to appeal to an audience but also to help and audiences got here how to finely slice parrot looks like that's a one minute video how to replace an egg in baking butter for 1 minute video how to roast chestnuts in an oven one minute and they are not as active as I expected their last video was posted 1 year ago and there Fail Safe staffing he just does as well as meals he does the or little thing you've got pigs in blankets with cranberry sauce and also another one minute tips which is how you make bread sauce show and how to safely freeze cooked meat so you don't do a lot of useful things on his channel as well as obviously fancy things I feel like you find a lot of these recipes in his books so it is another way to promote what he's already got I guess you could say this kind of Ryan's me and maybe I'll give him for the future of Alfie deyes pointless books were he's got an app to go with the book and if you hold do you like iPhone or camera phone device over a logo on the book it shows you it comes up with the video it just wrote Alfie doing that specific thing for example head cake mugs in there and mug cakes 40 he had mug cakes and he was just showing his audience how to make them through a video as well as it being in the book and I feel like maybe that something he could integrate to his channel potentially links of books more so that the more accessible for both YouTube answer the books and so he has got two million subscribers as I said and I did not expecting to be uploading that much but as he does that does not surprise me as much as I expected it to however Gordon Ramsay's last video was uploaded four days ago " .

it's mind your head it's Secklow sounds if I'm also shows where is a bit of a weird one really partly because of the fact that all the best laid plans go kind of up the wall really we're expecting book in the studio this evening unfortunately unable to attend so we're going to reschedule that and look young people's sexual health and well-being later date so tonight we're gonna look up well  \"ASOS Nixon axe and we're gonna look at anti-bullying week which is this week we can have international men's day and and some of the issues around suicide to men in the fact that we just a bit pants at talking about things we going to talk about some music the we've got we going to talk about the news we can Network Rail Twickenham it's a big present maybe in that family unit and sometimes but I think that can be very difficult trying to get that balances you know wanting Satan to maybe be there but not being able to it really it is so difficult to find out and again you get in that situation where  \"singing Manor not been may be able to talk about it you know why do nice things bottelino's feeling that can be very difficult I think so why are we when moving into a place I mean we talk about international women's day um where you know you get 24 hours um I receive 8760 hours but there are any late um that celebrate women and all of their achievements which is great um and therefore we know we've now got international men's day one of the reasons I think for international women's day and this is part of the conversation of having with Fitbit when we were doing their there they're their there is a chat about what's coming up tonight was around the idea that men are now feeling in some way similar pressures to women in terms of the pressure to look a certain way the pressure to be both strong and provide but equally in touch with their feelings and and and touchy feely and emotional and and all of those things  \"women have been texting with let's be honest you know time in memorial are now summer house and also crashes on men which is putting additional stressed additional and you know difficulty cement is this a good thing should we be saying actually this is a day where we can be encouraging men to say actually it's really quite some time to be in a bloke Nicholson it's not I need a minute self it's going to be affected if it has kids involved if I haven't got that right so it's not the size of figure acting the way a father should  \"610 swiss roll on step child has stopped then started the same problem because I've not had that support yet I agree on it I think it is it is so tied up in at the same is true of mothers have caught something we can't suggesting almost that it's always the mother that that States with the kids and in the past and drive cases it is partly because of the fact that that's kind of what's expected I think you should be maternal look after the children wear shorts and the court system is still in favour of women being mothers rather than being fathers just something I don't know hello welcome pack that was hozier and take me to Church which I think everybody agree with a very nice song we like that there apparently is very good live bands if you do get a chance can statements please take that chance to see if it with both hands go and see how the other bands are available all of whom or many of whom are quite good as well as some be playing at the Kiln Farm club tonight I might go and see £6 on the door wondering off family mother and father divorced when I was for both with their own mental health issues that was quite open honest about it would say I am going to kill myself I wish I had the bottle to kill mice when my mum was just completed this nervous records of those kind of plan restricted kind of frailty that she had that can deliver within the head that affect use a young as a young guys come out 67 years old with his dad saying I want to know what I want to kill myself I can't I can't begin to know you just seen the time it was just normal that was the way life was and over the years you can kinda become a default personal what you experience as a child and that that becomes you remove it didn't take much by the time I got to live in early to mid Twenties too kind of set me off on my mail this is because it was normal you know I almost went the other way I take responsibility for everything I will be used to put blame on even things which actually have had a very big impact on your life so I always felt if you turn around and say that your mental illness is because of your parents divorce you lost your saying that none of it's your fault and it's all your parents will call your parents fault um but you know when I start seeing a counsellor and began to unpack everything absolutely no he said no just look at it in plain obvious that you it started on travelling for you to depression kicked in a long time so you know stop being so hard on yourself and actually I think we can all you're manic Trigger's why you no you don't put them together this in the timeline xe.com have this conversation I'm out with my mates at the pub could do it should I say to him how you feel if you can talk to me now because I opened up with them first and it's about making the first move and I needed to talk to people and you know you probably do find that the more you talk to people than what you did you get it back Tesco hard hitting stuff I think um thank you very much to the three fellas who who made that made that video of mind I think one of the things that say that I take from that is the idea that the end people started talking once I started talking and I think that is really the crux of the matter here it's actually we've all got stuff we all have times where actually we need somebody to go WhatsApp how to help just somebody to listen while we say actually this is how I'm feeling the moment and once you kinda phone that's a possibility up within your group of friends you'll be astonished how many other people do it  \"we are all unique individuals um but yet we do have this common ground in the sense that was that  \"will house stuff but he says we have to deal with some time and yet sometimes we cope with that stuff and sometimes we just stone and you know it I like your face is having somewhere or someone to talk to it it's just almost open the Floodgates like the saying the fact that the guy at the end and no what's he started talking like a and a car  \"show me love me you know I'm not a weak individual I'm not only no I'm not I'm not a man and you know it's part of Being Human and again I think great the more that we hear those kind of conversations you know we're all just a little flawed individuals and we all need help sometime absolutely I mean we're talking about men because it's international men's day asking for help can you come and um because she doesn't want to be a burden and she thinks that if she asked people come round because she wants to talk to them that they feel obliged to rather than I said he's your mate talk to you mate it's ok to talk to your mates and say yeah I think of it if it is if one thing you take from this evening show ladies and gentlemen the little and talk about your stuff you'll be astonished that what you get back I don't know what you've watched it this program on at the moment I think it's called the life of 4 year olds it like that and I love that program because if you see the interactions between the lovely little kid they are so honest what they say comes right from the heart in and they're having in a maybe Little Hans runs because someone is going on the slide and they're not your friend anymore but they have real honest conversations and at what point do we lose that I'm not I find that really fascinating when when do we lose the ability just to be honest and be totally yourself that it's up there is something lovely but it's all I can say is that the children the thought the husband the father or whatever is is a bread winner sorry can't actually the week is got to show that you're strong but I think you're right I mean I think that's the breadwinner angle I think there's also that that kind of I am a man and I will look after my family element to it as well um yeah I mean I think you know that that that honestly as you say this is the secret life of 4 year olds high quality that about the job thing going back this is my sounds and we are talking we were talking about that and now going to talk about this it is anti-bullying week so you've got something in front of you I think it's fantastic tells about it's from the break the stigma group and it says yes I have a mental illness that does not mean I am crazy scary unlovable dangerous violent or weak stupid weird unreasonable a loser attention seeker  \"the brewery in terms of I suppose mental health and well-being happiness how how much should we be saying it's important for us to focus on men becoming Good Men so they can become good Father's is this something that we should be wearing that or is it something that's just in a man of God I've got a day we want a day to you know which happens certainly in services  \"certificates needed um and I think we are getting better at it I think men are getting better at talking about things as me some really good I think Media the last few months or so on the radio and the TV been doing really quite a lot of programs around kind of the male suicide excetra and I'm really high lighting in offices of all we talk about it the more  \"if you don't got mental illness so you don't get sick ties with those soft science language that we use around mental mental health and mental illness is crucial you know we've had the situation this week with with thermistor Livingston delightful little Nutella this year's movies has produced family is nothing to be sorry just come out an apologized profusely I think you know right Lisa but I think it just goes to show how easily we throw around those terms in bandidos terms you know you need to go uni to belittle and the main the experiences of people with mental illness have and to score cheat points or or or or to make jokes and this will challenge  \"can I think it I like it I love it it's so I don't know whether you would agree with this in the same way as wheat with kind come on a journey in terms of the language we use around for example some of our BME black minority ethnic Communities we don't use the n word anymore we don't use the P word anymore you don't talk about something offensive slang terms for the corner shop for the Chinese restaurant all of us something we accept that those that we've moved away on the whole I think from the offensive slang terms around the lesbian gay bisexual transgender community and I was on acceptable we still have a situation where I think there is a journey for people to go on in terms of moving in the same direction in terms of language around stigma and mental health and I hope we can get there I hope that just because we don't talk about it which is not educated understand all the different things that go around fence of hell because again it's that conversation about what is meant what is mental health you know but I wonder why we're we're still lagging behind with  \"hi I have my own proposal and I think this links in beautifully to a series theme of Dignity I think if you look at the messages that come from those in power with regard to mental health mental health is seen as a second class service we are not seen as important there isn't priority for mental health and if you look at spending on mental health is always the first to be cut if you look at the fact that we've only just got waiting lists for access to mental health services in they're not really are adhered to in anyway if you look at the fact that some people with mental health problems in US government is being investigated by the EU commission for human rights human rights abuses towards people with disabilities if you look at the language that was used the scroungers because they're on benefits Ashley there are many people who are unite the fact that if your own if you've got her a non visible disability and you park in a disabled parking space you're getting abused for the fact that you that you think you'll find it's a bloody wheelchair  \"Chris Bush Fair shopping so because she walked and the lack of understanding the lack of knowledge I think it is that there is an element of it which is that actually if you look at the messages that come from those in power and those that those are very easily picked up by the general public and therefore it's an easy target and when you've got the government almost running up and election campaign based upon the stigmatization of a group of people  \"it's perfectly reasonable checked it except for the general public to pick up on that and I actually it's fine for us we then the government says so let's set the example here to be fair you know this isn't a little party I think if you look back to talk to the previous the previous government before the coalition government coalition government it's a really good stuff they did some really bad stuff for the Labour government was in power for some really good stuff really bad stuff in the workplace assessment of the current government and the messages that have been sent consistently over many many years  \"anyway we were going to talk about anti-bullying week there's been a whole heap of stuff around the importance of acknowledging in understanding the impact that bullying has on young people's mental health moving into Adulthood so this week is anti-bullying week and the key aims of the week according to the anti-bullying Alliance that will get U K and R to empower children young people to make a noise about bullying what is happening to them or someone else face-to-face please me or online and to help parents and carers have conversations with their children about bullying  \"photos of Way of preventing bullying and to help children who are worried about bullying to encourage talking schools where all children and young people are given a safe space to discuss bullying and other issues that affect their lives and I'll supported to report all forms of bullying I don't have some really really important to equip teachers to respond effectively when children tell them they're being bullied and to raise awareness of the impact of bullying on children's lives if they don't tell anyone it's happening or if they're not given appropriate support with a focus on the impact on mental health so those are things are you know if I've really important things in terms of what anti-bullying weeks about um I don't know what experience or otherwise you know people and Stuart have had with regard to bullying all of the impact that it might lead on some people I was bullied as a child for about 3 years  \"seyberts super cool colours you know High School colours bully but you come as well for me I'm probably very similar to a lot of people you can have just learnt how to deal with it learn how to avoid you know you just can't put on that can an invisible cloak it's not bothering me but I can't say that it didn't bother me and we'll be saying in the break I am I remember meeting this particular person who has left school like she sat on the bus with her and have a conversation with her for a good half an hour on this journey as if we have been best mates throughout all this time and I remember thinking this is so surreal almost an anova see in a way the same I didn't have the courage to say did you know that you made my life of p or misery 443 is it obviously had no idea the impacts or what she should actually been doing and it was it was quite ironic and away but I think that's that that's the case for a lot of people having her at her but I certainly didn't admit that anybody is a none of my friends none of my family just kept that all to myself and just love avoidance techniques and but yeah I'm sure there are so many people like that have very very similar story I think you're probably right I am only I think it's in this is about children particularly but I think that there is bullying in the workplace it's really pleased  \"understandably wrong and there is legislation now in place to prevent the happening unless you you know a workplace assessor or the government in which case is absolutely fine if you did Billy disabled people on last time I can I get home  \"answer state again like I said this is this isn't any political party specific this is this is government specific I wanna watch this now  \"particular mean it's really interesting with the kids so that you and I don't know whether this is the same impression that you bye Felicia see Lizzy is quite together pretty confident preschool you know feels with stills with their stuff you know you know you really love the idea of you kind of suffering alone and  \"place for anybody to be a man for you but what 14/15 just a Grim old time for that to happen and the impact last night and reducing stigma but it is interesting what you were saying about creating a male role model and yes I think it is important um and also you can be in a situation as well where maybe how do I put this you know having that male role models sometimes it also difficult for that mail to be the real me " .

talk to strangers I think after the Ozzy Osbourne giggling deals for me the most of the hottest ticket in the early eighty's so you imagine all the hottest players around the world would have been going for this but you put Campbell is a great combination of firms like a certain pyrotechnical next stage Gary Moore along with some us flash does SPD roofing that Randy did and elements of Van

because you talk classical influences them I was kind of feeling that we will listen to these tracks but I didn't think I ought to say the wrong thing is about other areas of music and they weren't afraid about someone who influences Loud and Proud classical elements actually pre match pump parts of almost every single player in the next few Mum saying is did the most over example today but um Shankar Deathly Hallows history corruption my sink is one of the most pivotal and them influential is 90 seconds of guitar others period a lot of bands some combined the smallest pop age of acts in

jewellery but if it was a very special deal I would buy something like that for my family full term of Riches wealth opening be rich and happiness can you be rich in the things you have to be rich in love it it is the pay and afterwards I will decide what I would if I won that money I would not know what to say lots of money I think I'd give some to charity I'll keep for myself and yell common

some away for a nice new house something really nice that you would like in your life so don't don't spend your money straight away just save some and spend it on what you would like to spend when it's not have to do money wise like what and Nathan is said you can be rich on love you can be rich on the happiness St James and Kano now joined us do some seven monies a good idea would you save
